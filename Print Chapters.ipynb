      "Harry managed not to shout out, but it was a close thing. The little creature on the bed had large, bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls. Harry knew instantly that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge that morning. As they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley's voice from the hall. \"May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?\" The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long, thin nose touched the carpet. Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase, with rips for arm- and leg-holes. \"Er — hello,\" said Harry nervously. \"Harry Potter!\" said the creature in a high-pitched voice Harry was sure would carry down the stairs. \"So long has Dobby wanted to meet you, sir . . . Such an honor it is. . . .\" \"Th-thank you,\" said Harry, edging along the wall and sinking into his desk chair, next to Hedwig, who was asleep in her large cage. He wanted to ask, \"What are you?\" but thought it would sound too rude, so instead he said, \"Who are you?\" \n",
      "\"Dobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the house-elf,\" said the creature. \n",
      "\"Oh — really?\" said Harry. \"Er — I don't want to be rude or anything, but — this isn't a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.\" \n",
      "Aunt Petunia's high, false laugh sounded from the living room. The elf hung his head. \n",
      "\"Not that I'm not pleased to meet you,\" said Harry quickly, \"but, er, is there any particular reason you're here?\" \n",
      "\"Oh, yes, sir,\" said Dobby earnestly. \"Dobby has come to tell you, sir . . . it is difficult, sir . . . Dobby wonders where to begin. . . .\" \n",
      "\"Sit down,\" said Harry politely, pointing at the bed. \n",
      "To his horror, the elf burst into tears — very noisy tears. \n",
      "\"S-sit down!\" he wailed. \"Never . . . never ever . . .\" \n",
      "Harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter. \n",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" he whispered, \"I didn't mean to offend you or anything —\" \n",
      "\"Offend Dobby!\" choked the elf. \"Dobby has never been asked to sit down by a wizard — like an equal —\" \n",
      "Harry, trying to say \"Shh!\" and look comforting at the same time, ushered Dobby back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing, looking like a large and very ugly doll. At last he managed to control himself, and sat with his great eyes fixed on Harry in an expression of watery adoration. \"You can't have met many decent wizards,\" said Harry, trying to cheer him up. \n",
      "Dobby shook his head. Then, without warning, he leapt up and started banging his head furiously on the window, shouting, \"Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!\" \n",
      "\"Don't — what are you doing?\" Harry hissed, springing up and pulling Dobby back onto the bed — Hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage. \n",
      "\"Dobby had to punish himself, sir,\" said the elf, who had gone slightly cross-eyed. \"Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir. . . .\" \n",
      "\"Your family?\" \n",
      "\"The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. . . . Dobby is a house-elf — bound to serve one house and one family forever. . . .\" \n",
      "\"Do they know you're here?\" asked Harry curiously. \n",
      "Dobby shuddered. \n",
      "\"Oh, no, sir, no . . . Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see you, sir. Dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this. If they ever knew, sir —\" \n",
      "\"But won't they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door?\" \n",
      "\"Dobby doubts it, sir. Dobby is always having to punish himself for something, sir. They lets Dobby get on with it, sir. Sometimes they reminds me to do extra punishments. . . .\" \n",
      "\"But why don't you leave? Escape?\" \n",
      "\"A house-elf must be set free, sir. And the family will never set Dobby free . . . Dobby will serve the family until he dies, sir. . . .\" \n",
      "Harry stared. \n",
      "\"And I thought I had it bad staying here for another four weeks,\"  he said. \"This makes the Dursleys sound almost human. Can't anyone help you? Can't I?\" \n",
      "Almost at once, Harry wished he hadn't spoken. Dobby dissolved again into wails of gratitude. \n",
      "\"Please,\" Harry whispered frantically, \"please be quiet. If the Dursleys hear anything, if they know you're here —\" \n",
      "\"Harry Potter asks if he can help Dobby . . . Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but of your goodness, Dobby never knew. . . .\" \n",
      "Harry, who was feeling distinctly hot in the face, said, \"Whatever you've heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish. I'm not even top of my year at Hogwarts; that's Hermione, she —\" \n",
      "But he stopped quickly, because thinking about Hermione was painful. \n",
      "\"Harry Potter is humble and modest,\" said Dobby reverently, his orb-like eyes aglow. \"Harry Potter speaks not of his triumph over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named —\" \n",
      "\"Voldemort?\" said Harry. \n",
      "Dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned, \"Ah, speak not the name, sir! Speak not the name!\" \n",
      "\"Sorry,\" said Harry quickly. \"I know lots of people don't like it. My friend Ron —\" \n",
      "He stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful, too. \n",
      "Dobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as headlights. \n",
      "\"Dobby heard tell,\" he said hoarsely, \"that Harry Potter met the Dark Lord for a second time, just weeks ago . . . that Harry Potter escaped yet again.\" \n",
      "Harry nodded and Dobby's eyes suddenly shone with tears. \n",
      "\"Ah, sir,\" he gasped, dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby  pillowcase he was wearing. \"Harry Potter is valiant and bold! He has braved so many dangers already! But Dobby has come to protect Harry Potter, to warn him, even if he does have to shut his ears in the oven door later. . . . Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts.\" \n",
      "There was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from downstairs and the distant rumble of Uncle Vernon's voice. \n",
      "\"W-what?\" Harry stammered. \"But I've got to go back — term starts on September first. It's all that's keeping me going. You don't know what it's like here. I don't belong here. I belong in your world — at Hogwarts.\" \n",
      "\"No, no, no,\" squeaked Dobby, shaking his head so hard his ears flapped. \"Harry Potter must stay where he is safe. He is too great, too good, to lose. If Harry Potter goes back to Hogwarts, he will be in mortal danger.\" \n",
      "\"Why?\" said Harry in surprise. \n",
      "\"There is a plot, Harry Potter. A plot to make most terrible things happen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year,\" whispered Dobby, suddenly trembling all over. \"Dobby has known it for months, sir. Harry Potter must not put himself in peril. He is too important, sir!\" \n",
      "\"What terrible things?\" said Harry at once. \"Who's plotting them?\" \n",
      "Dobby made a funny choking noise and then banged his head frantically against the wall. \n",
      "\"All right!\" cried Harry, grabbing the elf's arm to stop him. \"You can't tell me. I understand. But why are you warning me?\" A sudden, unpleasant thought struck him. \"Hang on — this hasn't got anything to do with Vol — sorry — with You-Know-Who, has it?  You could just shake or nod,\" he added hastily as Dobby's head \n",
      "tilted worryingly close to the wall again. \n",
      "Slowly, Dobby shook his head. \n",
      "\"Not — not He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, sir —\" \n",
      "But Dobby's eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give Harry a hint. Harry, however, was completely lost. \n",
      "\"He hasn't got a brother, has he?\" \n",
      "Dobby shook his head, his eyes wider than ever. \n",
      "\"Well then, I can't think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at Hogwarts,\" said Harry. \"I mean, there's Dumbledore, for one thing — you know who Dumbledore is, don't you?\" \n",
      "Dobby bowed his head. \n",
      "\"Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever had. Dobby knows it, sir. Dobby has heard Dumbledore's powers rival those of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his strength. But, sir\" — Dobby's voice dropped to an urgent whisper — \"there are powers Dumbledore doesn't . . . powers no decent wizard . . .\" \n",
      "And before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded off the bed, seized Harry's desk lamp, and started beating himself around the head with earsplitting yelps. \n",
      "A sudden silence fell downstairs. Two seconds later Harry, heart thudding madly, heard Uncle Vernon coming into the hall, calling, \"Dudley must have left his television on again, the little tyke!\" \n",
      "\"Quick! In the closet!\" hissed Harry, stuffing Dobby in, shutting the door, and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned. \"What — the — devil — are — you — doing?\" said Uncle Vernon through gritted teeth, his face horribly close to Harry's. \"You've just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke. . . . One more sound and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy!\" \n",
      "He stomped flat-footed from the room. \n",
      "Shaking, Harry let Dobby out of the closet. \n",
      "\"See what it's like here?\" he said. \"See why I've got to go back to Hogwarts? It's the only place I've got — well, I think I've got friends.\" \n",
      "\"Friends who don't even write to Harry Potter?\" said Dobby slyly. \n",
      "\"I expect they've just been — wait a minute,\" said Harry, frowning. \"How do you know my friends haven't been writing to me?\" \n",
      "Dobby shuffled his feet. \n",
      "\"Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby. Dobby did it for the best —\" \n",
      "\"Have you been stopping my letters?\" \n",
      "\"Dobby has them here, sir,\" said the elf. Stepping nimbly out of Harry's reach, he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase he was wearing. Harry could make out Hermione's neat writing, Ron's untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the Hogwarts gamekeeper, Hagrid. \n",
      "Dobby blinked anxiously up at Harry. \n",
      "\"Harry Potter mustn't be angry. . . . Dobby hoped . . . if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him . . . Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir. . . .\" \n",
      "Harry wasn't listening. He made a grab for the letters, but Dobby jumped out of reach. \n",
      "\"Harry Potter will have them, sir, if he gives Dobby his word  that he will not return to Hogwarts. Ah, sir, this is a danger you \n",
      "must not face! Say you won't go back, sir!\" \n",
      "\"No,\" said Harry angrily. \"Give me my friends' letters!\" \n",
      "\"Then Harry Potter leaves Dobby no choice,\" said the elf sadly. \n",
      "Before Harry could move, Dobby had darted to the bedroom door, pulled it open, and sprinted down the stairs. \n",
      "Mouth dry, stomach lurching, Harry sprang after him, trying not to make a sound. He jumped the last six steps, landing catlike on the hall carpet, looking around for Dobby. From the dining room he heard Uncle Vernon saying, \". . . tell Petunia that very funny story about those American plumbers, Mr. Mason. She's been dying to hear . . .\" \n",
      "Harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear. \n",
      "Aunt Petunia's masterpiece of a pudding, the mountain of cream and sugared violets, was floating up near the ceiling. On top of a cupboard in the corner crouched Dobby. \n",
      "\"No,\" croaked Harry. \"Please . . . they'll kill me. . . .\" \n",
      "\"Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school —\" \n",
      "\"Dobby . . . please . . .\" \n",
      "\"Say it, sir —\" \n",
      "\"I can't —\" \n",
      "Dobby gave him a tragic look. \n",
      "\"Then Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter's own good.\" \n",
      "The pudding fell to the floor with a heart-stopping crash. Cream splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered. With a crack like a whip, Dobby vanished. \n",
      "There were screams from the dining room and Uncle Vernon  burst into the kitchen to find Harry, rigid with shock, covered from head to foot in Aunt Petunia's pudding. \n",
      "At first, it looked as though Uncle Vernon would manage to gloss the whole thing over. (\"Just our nephew — very disturbed — meeting strangers upsets him, so we kept him upstairs. . . .\") He shooed the shocked Masons back into the dining room, promised Harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the Masons had left, and handed him a mop. Aunt Petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer and Harry, still shaking, started scrubbing the kitchen clean. \n",
      "Uncle Vernon might still have been able to make his deal — if it hadn't been for the owl. \n",
      "Aunt Petunia was just passing around a box of after-dinner mints when a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window, dropped a letter on Mrs. Mason's head, and swooped out again. Mrs. Mason screamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting about lunatics. Mr. Mason stayed just long enough to tell the Dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes, and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke. \n",
      "Harry stood in the kitchen, clutching the mop for support, as Uncle Vernon advanced on him, a demonic glint in his tiny eyes. \n",
      "\"Read it!\" he hissed evilly, brandishing the letter the owl had delivered. \"Go on — read it!\" \n",
      "Harry took it. It did not contain birthday greetings. \n",
      "Dear Mr. Potter, \n",
      "We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was \n",
      "used at your place of residence this evening at twelve min\n",
      "utes past nine. As you know, underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells outside school, and further spellwork on your part may lead to expulsion from said school (Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery, 1875, Paragraph C). \n",
      "We would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that risks notice by members of the non-magical community (Muggles) is a serious offense under section 13 of the International Confederation of Warlocks' Statute of Secrecy. \n",
      "Enjoy your holidays! Yours sincerely, \n",
      "\n",
      "Mafalda Hopkirk \n",
      "improper use of magic office \n",
      "Ministry of Magic \n",
      "Harry looked up from the letter and gulped. \n",
      "\"You didn't tell us you weren't allowed to use magic outside school,\" said Uncle Vernon, a mad gleam dancing in his eyes. \"Forgot to mention it. . . . Slipped your mind, I daresay. . . .\" \n",
      "He was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog, all his teeth bared. \"Well, I've got news for you, boy. . . . I'm locking you up. . . . You're never going back to that school . . . never . . . and if you try and magic yourself out — they'll expel you!\" \n",
      "And laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry back upstairs. \n",
      "Uncle Vernon was as bad as his word. The following morning, he paid a man to fit bars on Harry's window. He himself fitted a cat-flap in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day. They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was locked in his room around the clock. \n",
      "Three days later, the Dursleys were showing no sign of relenting, and Harry couldn't see any way out of his situation. He lay on his bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to him. \n",
      "What was the good of magicking himself out of his room if Hogwarts would expel him for doing it? Yet life at Privet Drive had reached an all-time low. Now that the Dursleys knew they weren't going to wake up as fruit bats, he had lost his only weapon. Dobby might have saved Harry from horrible happenings at Hogwarts, but the way things were going, he'd probably starve to death anyway. \n",
      "The cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunia's hand appeared, pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room. Harry, whose insides were aching with hunger, jumped off his bed and seized it. The soup was stone-cold, but he drank half of it in one gulp. Then he crossed the room to Hedwig's cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray. She ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of deep disgust. \n",
      "\"It's no good turning your beak up at it — that's all we've got,\" said Harry grimly. \n",
      "He put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat-flap and lay back down on the bed, somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup. Supposing he was still alive in another four weeks, what would happen if he didn't turn up at Hogwarts? Would someone be sent to see why he hadn't come back? Would they be able to make the Dursleys let him go? \n",
      "The room was growing dark. Exhausted, stomach rumbling, mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions, Harry fell into an uneasy sleep. \n",
      "He dreamed that he was on show in a zoo, with a card reading underage wizard attached to his cage. People goggled through the bars at him as he lay, starving and weak, on a bed of straw. He saw Dobby's face in the crowd and shouted out, asking for help, but Dobby called, \"Harry Potter is safe there, sir!\" and vanished. Then the Dursleys appeared and Dudley rattled the bars of the cage, laughing at him. \n",
      "\"Stop it,\" Harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head. \"Leave me alone . . . cut it out . . . I'm trying to sleep. . . .\" \n",
      "He opened his eyes. Moonlight was shining through the bars on the window. And someone was goggling through the bars at him: a freckle-faced, red-haired, long-nosed someone. \n",
      "Ron Weasley was outside Harry's window.\n"

      "Autumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year. The morning of the first of September was crisp and golden as an apple, and as the little family bobbed across the rumbling road toward the great sooty station, the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like cobwebs in the cold air. Two large cages rattled on top of the laden trolleys the parents were pushing; the owls inside them hooted indignantly, and the redheaded girl trailed tearfully behind her brothers, clutching her father's arm. \"It won't be long, and you'll be going too,\" Harry told her. \"Two years,\" sniffed Lily. \"I want to go now!\" \n",
      "The commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Albus's voice drifted back to Harry over the surrounding clamor; his sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car. \n",
      "\"I won't! I won't be in Slytherin!\" \n",
      "\"James, give it a rest!\" said Ginny.\"I only said he might be,\" said James, grinning at his younger brother. \"There's nothing wrong with that. He might be in Slyth —\" \n",
      "But James caught his mother's eye and fell silent. The five Potters approached the barrier. With a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger brother, James took the trolley from his mother and broke into a run. A moment later, he had vanished. \n",
      "\"You'll write to me, won't you?\" Albus asked his parents immediately, capitalizing on the momentary absence of his brother. \n",
      "\"Every day, if you want us to,\" said Ginny. \n",
      "\"Not every day,\" said Albus quickly. \"James says most people only get letters from home about once a month.\" \n",
      "\"We wrote to James three times a week last year,\" said Ginny. \n",
      "\"And you don't want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts,\" Harry put in. \"He likes a laugh, your brother.\" \n",
      "Side by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering speed. As they reached the barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came. Instead, the family emerged onto platform nine and three-quarters, which was obscured by thick white steam that was pouring from the scarlet Hogwarts Express. Indistinct figures were swarming through the mist, into which James had already disappeared. \n",
      "\"Where are they?\" asked Albus anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they passed as they made their way down the platform. \n",
      "\"We'll find them,\" said Ginny reassuringly. \n",
      "But the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody's faces. Detached from their owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud. Harry thought he heard Percy discoursing loudly on broomstick regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello. . . . \"I think that's them, Al,\" said Ginny suddenly. \n",
      "A group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the very last carriage. Their faces only came into focus when Harry, Ginny, Lily, and Albus had drawn right up to them. \n",
      "\"Hi,\" said Albus, sounding immensely relieved. Rose, who was already wearing her brand-new Hogwarts robes, beamed at him. \n",
      "\"Parked all right, then?\" Ron asked Harry. \"I did. Hermione didn't believe I could pass a Muggle driving test, did you? She thought I'd have to Confund the examiner.\" \n",
      "\"No, I didn't,\" said Hermione, \"I had complete faith in you.\" \n",
      "\"As a matter of fact, I did Confund him,\" Ron whispered to Harry, as together they lifted Albus's trunk and owl onto the train. \"I only forgot to look in the wing mirror, and let's face it, I can use a Supersensory Charm for that.\" \n",
      "Back on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose's younger brother, having an animated discussion about which House they would be sorted into when they finally went to Hogwarts. \n",
      "\"If you're not in Gryffindor, we'll disinherit you,\" said Ron, \"but no pressure.\" \n",
      "\"Ron!\" \n",
      "Lily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn. \n",
      "\"He doesn't mean it,\" said Hermione and Ginny, but Ron was no longer paying attention. Catching Harry's eye, he nodded covertly to a point some fifty yards away. The steam had thinned for a moment, and three people stood in sharp relief against the shifting mist. \n",
      "\"Look who it is.\" \n",
      "Draco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark coat buttoned up to his throat. His hair was receding somewhat,which emphasized the pointed chin. The new boy resembled Draco as much as Albus resembled Harry. Draco caught sight of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny staring at him, nodded curtly, and turned away again. \n",
      "\"So that's little Scorpius,\" said Ron under his breath. \"Make sure you beat him in every test, Rosie. Thank God you inherited your mother's brains.\" \n",
      "\"Ron, for heaven's sake,\" said Hermione, half stern, half amused. \"Don't try to turn them against each other before they've even started school!\" \n",
      "\"You're right, sorry,\" said Ron, but unable to help himself, he added, \"Don't get too friendly with him, though, Rosie. Granddad Weasley would never forgive you if you married a pureblood.\" \n",
      "\"Hey!\" \n",
      "James had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl, and trolley, and was evidently bursting with news. \n",
      "\"Teddy's back there,\" he said breathlessly, pointing back over his shoulder into the billowing clouds of steam. \"Just seen him! And guess what he's doing? Snogging Victoire!\" \n",
      "He gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction. \n",
      "\"Our Teddy! Teddy Lupin! Snogging our Victoire! Our cousin! And I asked Teddy what he was doing —\" \n",
      "\"You interrupted them?\" said Ginny. \"You are so like Ron —\" \n",
      "\"— and he said he'd come to see her off! And then he told me to go away. He's snogging her!\" James added as though worried he had not made himself clear. \n",
      "\"Oh, it would be lovely if they got married!\" whispered Lily ecstatically. \"Teddy would really be part of the family then!\" \"He already comes round for dinner about four times a week,\" said Harry. \"Why don't we just invite him to live with us and have done with it?\" \n",
      "\"Yeah!\" said James enthusiastically. \"I don't mind sharing with Al — Teddy could have my room!\" \"No,\" said Harry firmly, \"you and Al will share a room only when I want the house demolished.\" He checked the battered old watch that had once been Fabian Prewett's. \n",
      "\"It's nearly eleven, you'd better get on board.\" \n",
      "\"Don't forget to give Neville our love!\" Ginny told James as she hugged him. \"Mum! I can't give a professor love!\" \"But you know Neville —\" James rolled his eyes. \"Outside, yeah, but at school he's Professor Longbottom, isn't he? I can't walk into Herbology and give him love. . . .\" \n",
      "Shaking his head at his mother's foolishness, he vented his feelings by aiming a kick at Albus. \"See you later, Al. Watch out for the thestrals.\" \"I thought they were invisible? You said they were invisible!\" But James merely laughed, permitted his mother to kiss him, \n",
      "gave his father a fleeting hug, then leapt onto the rapidly filling train. They saw him wave, then sprint away up the corridor to find his friends. \n",
      "\"Thestrals are nothing to worry about,\" Harry told Albus. \"They're gentle things, there's nothing scary about them. Anyway, you won't be going up to school in the carriages, you'll be going in the boats.\"Ginny kissed Albus good-bye. \n",
      "\"See you at Christmas.\" \n",
      "\"Bye, Al,\" said Harry as his son hugged him. \"Don't forget Hagrid's invited you to tea next Friday. Don't mess with Peeves. Don't duel anyone till you've learned how. And don't let James wind you up.\" \n",
      "\"What if I'm in Slytherin?\" \n",
      "The whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only the moment of departure could have forced Albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was. \n",
      "Harry crouched down so that Albus's face was slightly above his own. Alone of Harry's three children, Albus had inherited Lily's eyes. \n",
      "\"Albus Severus,\" Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to Rose, who was now on the train, \"you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.\" \n",
      "\"But just say —\" \n",
      "\"— then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student, won't it? It doesn't matter to us, Al. But if it matters to you, you'll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.\" \n",
      "\"Really?\" \n",
      "\"It did for me,\" said Harry. \n",
      "He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in Albus's face when he said it. But now the doors were slamming all along the scarlet train, and the blurred outlines of parents were swarming forward for final kisses, last-minute reminders. Albus jumped into the carriage and Ginny closed the door behind him. Students were hanging from the windows nearest them. A great number of faces, both on the train and off, seemed to be turned toward Harry. \n",
      "\"Why are they all staring?\" demanded Albus as he and Rose craned around to look at the other students. \n",
      "\"Don't let it worry you,\" said Ron. \"It's me. I'm extremely famous.\" \n",
      "Albus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. The train began to move, and Harry walked alongside it, watching his son's thin face, already ablaze with excitement. Harry kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a little bereavement, watching his son glide away from him. . . . \n",
      "The last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. The train rounded a corner. Harry's hand was still raised in farewell. \n",
      "\"He'll be all right,\" murmured Ginny. \n",
      "As Harry looked at her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched the lightning scar on his forehead. \n",
      "\"I know he will.\" \n",
      "The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.\n"
