      "Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day. \"Up! Get up! Now!\" Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again. \"Up!\" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before. His aunt was back outside the door. \"Are you up yet?\" she demanded. \"Nearly,\" said Harry. \"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don't you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday.\" Harry groaned. \"What did you say?\" his aunt snapped through the door. \"Nothing, nothing . . .\" Dudley's birthday — how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he  wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast. Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. \"In the car crash when your parents died,\" she had said. \"And don't ask questions.\" Don't ask questions — that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon. \"Comb your hair!\" he barked, by way of a morning greeting. About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put  together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way — all over the place. Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel — Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell. \"Thirty-six,\" he said, looking up at his mother and father. \"That's two less than last year.\" \"Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.\" \"All right, thirty-seven then,\" said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, \"And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today. How's that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right?\" Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, \"So I'll have thirty . . . thirty . . .\" \"Thirty-nine, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia. \"Oh.\" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \"All right then.\" Uncle Vernon chuckled. \"Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like his father. 'Atta boy, Dudley!\" He ruffled Dudley's hair. At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried. \"Bad news, Vernon,\" she said. \"Mrs. Figg's broken her leg. She can't take him.\" She jerked her head in Harry's direction. Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned. \"Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he'd planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbies, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again. \"We could phone Marge,\" Uncle Vernon suggested. \"Don't be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\" The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't there — or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't understand them, like a slug. \"What about what's-her-name, your friend — Yvonne?\" \"On vacation in Majorca,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \"You could just leave me here,\" Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley's computer). Aunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon. \"And come back and find the house in ruins?\" she snarled. \"I won't blow up the house,\" said Harry, but they weren't listening. \"I suppose we could take him to the zoo,\" said Aunt Petunia slowly, \". . . and leave him in the car. . . .\" \"That cars new, he's not sitting in it alone. . . .\" Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn't really crying — it had been years since he'd really cried — but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted. \"Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special day!\" she cried, flinging her arms around him. \"I . . . don't . . . want . . . him . . . t-t-to come!\" Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \"He always sp-spoils everything!\" He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms. Just then, the doorbell rang — \"Oh, good Lord, they're here!\" said Aunt Petunia frantically — and a moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. \"I'm warning you,\" he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry's, \"I'm warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you'll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.\" I'm not going to do anything,\" said Harry, \"honestly . . .\" But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him. No one ever did. The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen. Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \"to hide that horrible scar.\" Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly. Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn't punished. On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump. But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg's cabbage-smelling living room. While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles. \". . . roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\" he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. \"I had a dream about a motorcycle,\" said Harry, remembering suddenly. \"It was flying.\" Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \"MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY!\" Dudley and Piers sniggered. \"I know they don't,\" said Harry. \"It was only a dream.\" But he wished he hadn't said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas. It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn't blond. Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last. After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car and crushed it into a trash can — but at the moment it didn't look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep. Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. \"Make it move,\" he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn't budge. \"Do it again,\" Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. \"This is boring,\" Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself — no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's. It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren't. He looked back at the snake and winked, too. The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: \"I get that all the time.\" \"I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the snake could hear him. \"It must be really annoying.\" The snake nodded vigorously. \"Where do you come from, anyway?\" Harry asked. The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. Boa Constrictor, Brazil. \"Was it nice there?\" The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. \"Oh, I see — so you've never been to Brazil?\" As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. \"DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT IT'S DOING!\" Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. \"Out of the way, you,\" he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \"Brazil, here I come. . . . Thanksss, amigo.\" The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. \"But the glass,\" he kept saying, \"where did the glass go?\" The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \"Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?\" Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, \"Go — cupboard — stay — no meals,\" before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy. Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food. He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn't remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green light came from. He  couldn't remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house. When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look. At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.\n"

      "Black shapes were emerging out of thin air all around them, blocking their way left and right; eyes glinted through slits in hoods, a dozen lit wand tips were pointing directly at their hearts. Ginny gave a gasp of horror. \"To me, Potter,\" repeated the drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy as he held out his hand, palm up. Harry's insides plummeted sickeningly. They were trapped and outnumbered two to one. \"To me,\" said Malfoy yet again. \"Where's Sirius?\" Harry said. Several of the Death Eaters laughed. A harsh female voice from the midst of the shadowy figures to Harry's left said triumphantly, \"The Dark Lord always knows!\" \"Always,\" echoed Malfoy softly. \"Now, give me the prophecy, Potter.\" \"I want to know where Sirius is!\" \"I want to know where Sirius is!\" mimicked the woman to his left. She and her fellow Death Eaters had closed in so that they were mere feet away from Harry and the others, the light from their wands dazzling Harry's eyes. \"You've got him,\" said Harry, ignoring the rising panic in his chest, the dread he had been fighting since they had first entered the ninety-seventh row. \"He's here. I know he is.\" \"The little baby woke up fwightened and fort what it dweamed was twoo,\" said the woman in a horrible, mock-baby voice. Harry felt Ron stir beside him. \"Don't do anything,\" he muttered. \"Not yet —\" The woman who had mimicked him let out a raucous scream of laughter. \"You hear him? You hear him? Giving instructions to the other children as though he thinks of fighting us!\" \"Oh, you don't know Potter as I do, Bellatrix,\" said Malfoy softly. \"He has a great weakness for heroics; the Dark Lord understands this about him. Now give me the prophecy, Potter.\" \"I know Sirius is here,\" said Harry, though panic was causing his chest to constrict and he felt as though he could not breathe properly. \"I know you've got him!\" More of the Death Eaters laughed, though the woman still laughed loudest of all. \"It's time you learned the difference between life and dreams, Potter,\" said Malfoy. \"Now give me the prophecy, or we start using wands.\" \"Go on, then,\" said Harry, raising his own wand to chest height. As he did so, the five wands of Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny, and Luna rose on either side of him. The knot in Harry's stomach tightened. If Sirius really was not here, he had led his friends to their deaths for no reason at all. . . . But the Death Eaters did not strike. \"Hand over the prophecy and no one need get hurt,\" said Malfoy coolly. It was Harry's turn to laugh. \"Yeah, right!\" he said. \"I give you this — prophecy, is it? And you'll just let us skip off home, will you?\" The words were hardly out of his mouth when the female Death Eater shrieked, \"Accio Proph —\" Harry was just ready for her. He shouted \"Protego!\" before she had finished her spell, and though the glass sphere slipped to the tips of his fingers he managed to cling on to it. \"Oh, he knows how to play, little bitty baby Potter,\" she said, her mad eyes staring through the slits in her hood. \"Very well, then —\" \"I TOLD YOU, NO!\" Lucius Malfoy roared at the woman. \"If you smash it — !\" Harry's mind was racing. The Death Eaters wanted this dusty spun-glass sphere. He had no interest in it. He just wanted to get them all out of this alive, make sure that none of his friends paid a terrible price for his stupidity . . . The woman stepped forward, away from her fellows, and pulled off her hood. Azkaban had hollowed Bellatrix Lestrange's face, making it gaunt and skull-like, but it was alive with a feverish, fanatical glow. \"You need more persuasion?\" she said, her chest rising and falling rapidly. \"Very well — take the smallest one,\" she ordered the Death Eaters beside her. \"Let him watch while we torture the little girl. I'll do it.\" Harry felt the others close in around Ginny. He stepped sideways so that he was right in front of her, the prophecy held up to his chest. \"You'll have to smash this if you want to attack any of us,\" he told Bellatrix. \"I don't think your boss will be too pleased if you come back without it, will he?\" She did not move; she merely stared at him, the tip of her tongue moistening her thin mouth. \"So,\" said Harry, \"what kind of prophecy are we talking about anyway?\" He could not think what to do but to keep talking. Neville's arm was pressed against his, and he could feel him shaking. He could feel one of the other's quickened breath on the back of his head. He was hoping they were all thinking hard about ways to get out of this, because his mind was blank. \"What kind of prophecy?\" repeated Bellatrix, the grin fading from her face. \"You jest, Harry Potter.\" \"Nope, not jesting,\" said Harry, his eyes flicking from Death Eater to Death Eater, looking for a weak link, a space through which they could escape. \"How come Voldemort wants it?\" Several of the Death Eaters let out low hisses. \"You dare speak his name?\" whispered Bellatrix. \"Yeah,\" said Harry, maintaining his tight grip on the glass ball, expecting another attempt to bewitch it from him. \"Yeah, I've got no problem saying Vol —\" \"Shut your mouth!\" Bellatrix shrieked. \"You dare speak his name with your unworthy lips, you dare besmirch it with your half-blood's tongue, you dare —\" \"Did you know he's a half-blood too?\" said Harry recklessly. Hermione gave a little moan in his ear. \"Voldemort? Yeah, his mother was a witch but his dad was a Muggle — or has he been telling you lot he's pureblood?\" \"STUPEF —\" \"NO!\" A jet of red light had shot from the end of Bellatrix Lestrange's wand, but Malfoy had deflected it. His spell caused hers to hit the shelf a foot to the left of Harry and several of the glass orbs there shattered. Two figures, pearly white as ghosts, fluid as smoke, unfurled themselves from the fragments of broken glass upon the floor and each began to speak. Their voices vied with each other, so that only fragments  of what they were saying could be heard over Malfoy and Bellatrix's shouts. \". . . at the Solstice will come a new . . .\" said the figure of an old, bearded man. \"DO NOT ATTACK! WE NEED THE PROPHECY!\" \"He dared — he dares —\" shrieked Bellatrix incoherently. \"— He stands there — filthy half-blood —\" \"WAIT UNTIL WE'VE GOT THE PROPHECY!\" bawled Malfoy. \". . . and none will come after . . .\" said the figure of a young woman. The two figures that had burst from the shattered spheres had melted into thin air. Nothing remained of them or their erstwhile homes but fragments of glass upon the floor. They had, however, given Harry an idea. The problem was going to be conveying it to the others. \"You haven't told me what's so special about this prophecy I'm supposed to be handing over,\" he said, playing for time. He moved his foot slowly sideways, feeling around for someone else's. \"Do not play games with us, Potter,\" said Malfoy. \"I'm not playing games,\" said Harry, half his mind on the conversation, half on his wandering foot. And then he found someone's toes and pressed down upon them. A sharp intake of breath behind him told him they were Hermione's. \"What?\" she whispered. \"Dumbledore never told you that the reason you bear that scar was hidden in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries?\" said Malfoy sneeringly. \"I — what?\" said Harry, and for a moment he quite forgot his plan. \"What about my scar?\" \"What?\" whispered Hermione more urgently behind him. \"Can this be?\" said Malfoy, sounding maliciously delighted; some of the Death Eaters were laughing again, and under cover of their laughter, Harry hissed to Hermione, moving his lips as little as possible, \"Smash shelves —\" \"Dumbledore never told you?\" Malfoy repeated. \"Well, this explains why you didn't come earlier, Potter, the Dark Lord wondered why —\" \"— when I say go —\" \"— you didn't come running when he showed you the place where it was hidden in your dreams. He thought natural curiosity would make you want to hear the exact wording. . . .\" \"Did he?\" said Harry. Behind him he felt rather than heard Hermione passing his message to the others and he sought to keep talking, to distract the Death Eaters. \"So he wanted me to come and get it, did he? Why?\" \"Why?\" Malfoy sounded incredulously delighted. \"Because the only people who are permitted to retrieve a prophecy from the Department of Mysteries, Potter, are those about whom it was made, as the Dark Lord discovered when he attempted to use others to steal it for him.\" \"And why did he want to steal a prophecy about me?\" \"About both of you, Potter, about both of you . . . Haven't you ever wondered why the Dark Lord tried to kill you as a baby?\" Harry stared into the slitted eyeholes through which Malfoy's gray eyes were gleaming. Was this prophecy the reason Harry's parents had died, the reason he carried his lightning-bolt scar? Was the answer to all of this clutched in his hand? \"Someone made a prophecy about Voldemort and me?\" he said quietly, gazing at Lucius Malfoy, his fingers tightening over the warm glass sphere in his hand. It was hardly larger than a Snitch and still gritty with dust. \"And he's made me come and get it for him? Why couldn't he come and get it himself?\" \"Get it himself?\" shrieked Bellatrix on a cackle of mad laughter. \"The Dark Lord, walk into the Ministry of Magic, when they are so sweetly ignoring his return? The Dark Lord, reveal himself to the Aurors, when at the moment they are wasting their time on my dear cousin?\" \"So he's got you doing his dirty work for him, has he?\" said Harry. \"Like he tried to get Sturgis to steal it — and Bode?\" \"Very good, Potter, very good . . .\" said Malfoy slowly. \"But the Dark Lord knows you are not unintell —\" \"NOW!\" yelled Harry. Five different voices behind him bellowed \"REDUCTO!\" Five curses flew in five different directions and the shelves opposite them exploded as they hit. The towering structure swayed as a hundred glass spheres burst apart, pearly-white figures unfurled into the air and floated there, their voices echoing from who knew what long-dead past amid the torrent of crashing glass and splintered wood now raining down upon the floor — \"RUN!\" Harry yelled, and as the shelves swayed precariously and more glass spheres began to pour from above, he seized a handful of Hermione's robes and dragged her forward, one arm over his head as chunks of shelf and shards of glass thundered down upon them. A Death Eater lunged forward through the cloud of dust and Harry elbowed him hard in the masked face. They were all yelling, there were cries of pain, thunderous crashes as the shelves collapsed upon themselves, weirdly echoing fragments of the Seers unleashed from their spheres — Harry found the way ahead clear and saw Ron, Ginny, and Luna sprint past him, their arms over their heads. Something heavy struck him on the side of the face but he merely ducked his head and sprinted onward; a hand caught him by the shoulder; he heard Hermione shout \"Stupefy!\" and the hand released him at once. They were at the end of row ninety-seven; Harry turned right and  began to sprint in earnest. He could hear footsteps right behind him and Hermione's voice urging Neville on. The door through which they had come was ajar straight ahead, Harry could see the glittering light of the bell jar, he pelted through it, the prophecy still clutched tight and safe in his hand, waited for the others to hurtle over the threshold before slamming the door behind them — \"Colloportus!\" gasped Hermione and the door sealed itself with an odd squelching noise. \"Where — where are the others?\" gasped Harry. He had thought that Ron, Luna, and Ginny had been ahead of them, that they would be waiting in this room, but there was nobody there. \"They must have gone the wrong way!\" whispered Hermione, terror in her face. \"Listen!\" whispered Neville. Footsteps and shouts echoed from behind the door they had just sealed. Harry put his ear close to the door to listen and heard Lucius Malfoy roar: \"Leave Nott, leave him, I say, the Dark Lord will not care for Nott's injuries as much as losing that prophecy — Jugson, come back here, we need to organize! We'll split into pairs and search, and don't forget, be gentle with Potter until we've got the prophecy, you can kill the others if necessary — Bellatrix, Rodolphus, you take the left, Crabbe, Rabastan, go right — Jugson, Dolohov, the door straight ahead — Macnair and Avery, through here — Rookwood, over there — Mulciber, come with me!\" \"What do we do?\" Hermione asked Harry, trembling from head to foot. \"Well, we don't stand here waiting for them to find us, for a start,\" said Harry. \"Let's get away from this door. . . .\" They ran, quietly as they could, past the shimmering bell jar where the tiny egg was hatching and unhatching, toward the exit into the  circular hallway at the far end of the room. They were almost there when Harry heard something large and heavy collide with the door Hermione had charmed shut. \"Stand aside!\" said a rough voice. \"Alohomora!\" As the door flew open, Harry, Hermione, and Neville dived under desks. They could see the bottom of the two Death Eaters' robes drawing nearer, their feet moving rapidly. \"They might've run straight through to the hall,\" said the rough voice. \"Check under the desks,\" said another. Harry saw the knees of the Death Eaters bend. Poking his wand out from under the desk he shouted, \"STUPEFY !\" A jet of red light hit the nearest Death Eater; he fell backward into a grandfather clock and knocked it over. The second Death Eater, however, had leapt aside to avoid Harry's spell and now pointed his own wand at Hermione, who had crawled out from under the desk to get a better aim. \"Avada —\" Harry launched himself across the floor and grabbed the Death Eater around the knees, causing him to topple and his aim to go awry. Neville overturned his desk in his anxiety to help; pointing his wand wildly at the struggling pair he cried, \"EXPELLIARMUS !\" Both Harry's and the Death Eater's wands flew out of their hands and soared back toward the entrance to the Hall of Prophecy; both scrambled to their feet and charged after them, the Death Eater in front and Harry hot on his heels, Neville bringing up the rear, plainly horrorstruck at what he had done. \"Get out of the way, Harry!\" yelled Neville, clearly determined to repair the damage. Harry flung himself sideways as Neville took aim again and shouted, \"STUPEFY !\" The jet of red light flew right over the Death Eater's shoulder and hit a glass-fronted cabinet on the wall full of variously shaped hourglasses. The cabinet fell to the floor and burst apart, glass flying everywhere, then sprang back up onto the wall, fully mended, then fell down again, and shattered — The Death Eater had snatched up his wand, which lay on the floor beside the glittering bell jar. Harry ducked down behind another desk as the man turned — his mask had slipped so that he could not see, he ripped it off with his free hand and shouted, \"STUP —\" \"STUPEFY !\" screamed Hermione, who had just caught up with them. The jet of red light hit the Death Eater in the middle of his chest; he froze, his arm still raised, his wand fell to the floor with a clatter and he collapsed backward toward the bell jar. Harry expected to hear a clunk, for the man to hit solid glass and slide off the jar onto the floor, but instead, his head sank through the surface of the bell jar as though it was nothing but a soap bubble and he came to rest, sprawled on his back on the table, with his head lying inside the jar full of glittering wind. \"Accio Wand !\" cried Hermione. Harry's wand flew from a dark corner into her hand and she threw it to him. \"Thanks,\" he said, \"right, let's get out of —\" \"Look out!\" said Neville, horrified, staring at the Death Eater's head in the bell jar. All three of them raised their wands again, but none of them struck. They were all gazing, openmouthed, appalled, at what was happening to the man's head. It was shrinking very fast, growing balder and balder, the black hair and stubble retracting into his skull, his cheeks smooth, his skull round and covered with a peachlike fuzz. . . . A baby's head now sat grotesquely on top of the thick, muscled neck of the Death Eater as he struggled to get up again. But even as they watched, their mouths open, the head began to swell to its previous proportions again, thick black hair was sprouting from the pate and chin. . . . \"It's time,\" said Hermione in an awestruck voice. \"Time . . .\" The Death Eater shook his ugly head again, trying to clear it, but before he could pull himself together again, it began to shrink back to babyhood once more. . . . There was a shout from a room nearby, then a crash and a scream. \"RON?\" Harry yelled, turning quickly from the monstrous transformation taking place before them. \"GINNY? LUNA?\" \"Harry!\" Hermione screamed. The Death Eater had pulled his head out of the bell jar. His appearance was utterly bizarre, his tiny baby's head bawling loudly while his thick arms flailed dangerously in all directions, narrowly missing Harry, who ducked. Harry raised his wand but to his amazement Hermione seized his arm. \"You can't hurt a baby!\" There was no time to argue the point. Harry could hear more footsteps growing louder from the Hall of Prophecy they had just left and knew, too late, that he ought not to have shouted and given away their position. \"Come on!\" he said again, and leaving the ugly baby-headed Death Eater staggering behind them, they took off for the door that stood ajar at the other end of the room, leading back into the black hallway. They had run halfway toward it when Harry saw through the open door two more Death Eaters running across the black room toward them. Veering left he burst instead into a small, dark, cluttered office and slammed the door behind them. \"Collo —\" began Hermione, but before she could complete the spell the door had burst open again and the two Death Eaters had come hurtling inside. With a cry of triumph, both yelled, \"IMPEDIMENTA!\" Harry, Hermione, and Neville were all knocked backward off their feet. Neville was thrown over the desk and disappeared from view, Hermione smashed into a bookcase and was promptly deluged in a cascade of heavy books; the back of Harry's head slammed into the stone wall behind him, tiny lights burst in front of his eyes, and for a moment he was too dizzy and bewildered to react. \"WE'VE GOT HIM!\" yelled the Death Eater nearest Harry, \"IN AN OFFICE OFF —\" \"Silencio!\" cried Hermione, and the man's voice was extinguished. He continued to mouth through the hole in his mask, but no sound came out; he was thrust aside by his fellow. \"Petrificus Totalus!\" shouted Harry, as the second Death Eater raised his wand. His arms and legs snapped together and he fell forward, facedown onto the rug at Harry's feet, stiff as a board and unable to move at all. \"Well done, Ha —\" But the Death Eater Hermione had just struck dumb made a sudden slashing movement with his wand from which flew a streak of what looked like purple flame. It passed right across Hermione's chest; she gave a tiny \"oh!\" as though of surprise and then crumpled onto the floor where she lay motionless. \"HERMIONE!\" Harry fell to his knees beside her as Neville crawled rapidly toward her from under the desk, his wand held up in front of him. The Death Eater kicked out hard at Neville's head as he emerged — his foot broke Neville's wand in two and connected with his face — Neville gave a howl of pain and recoiled, clutching his mouth and nose. Harry twisted around, his own wand held high, and saw that the Death Eater had ripped off his mask and was pointing his wand directly at Harry, who recognized the long, pale, twisted face from the Daily Prophet: Antonin Dolohov, the wizard who had murdered the Prewetts. Dolohov grinned. With his free hand, he pointed from the prophecy still clutched in Harry's hand, to himself, then at Hermione. Though he could no longer speak his meaning could not have been clearer: Give me the prophecy, or you get the same as her. . . . \"Like you won't kill us all the moment I hand it over anyway!\" said Harry. A whine of panic inside his head was preventing him thinking properly. He had one hand on Hermione's shoulder, which was still warm, yet did not dare look at her properly. Don't let her be dead, don't let her be dead, it's my fault if she's dead. . . . \"Whaddever you do, Harry,\" said Neville fiercely from under the desk, lowering his hands to show a clearly broken nose and blood pouring down his mouth and chin, \"don'd gib it to him!\" Then there was a crash outside the door, and Dolohov looked over his shoulder — the baby-headed Death Eater had appeared in the doorway, his head bawling, his great fists still flailing uncontrollably at everything around him. Harry seized his chance: \"PETRIFICUS TOTALUS!\" The spell hit Dolohov before he could block it, and he toppled forward across his comrade, both of them rigid as boards and unable to move an inch. \"Hermione,\" Harry said at once, shaking her as the baby-headed Death Eater blundered out of sight again. \"Hermione, wake up. . . .\" \"Whaddid he do to her?\" said Neville, crawling out from under the desk again to kneel at her other side, blood streaming from his rapidly swelling nose. \"I dunno. . . .\" Neville groped for Hermione's wrist. \"Dat's a pulse, Harry, I'b sure id is. . . .\" Such a powerful wave of relief swept through Harry that for a moment he felt light-headed. \"She's alive?\" \"Yeah, I dink so. . . .\" There was a pause in which Harry listened hard for the sounds of  more footsteps, but all he could hear were the whimpers and blunderings of the baby Death Eater in the next room. \"Neville, we're not far from the exit,\" Harry whispered. \"We're right next to that circular room. . . . If we can just get you across it and find the right door before any more Death Eaters come, I'll bet you can get Hermione up the corridor and into the lift. . . . Then you could find someone. . . . Raise the alarm . . .\" \"And whad are you going do do?\" said Neville, mopping his bleeding nose with his sleeve and frowning at Harry. \"I've got to find the others,\" said Harry. \"Well, I'b going do find dem wid you,\" said Neville firmly. \"But Hermione —\" \"We'll dake her wid us,\" said Neville firmly. \"I'll carry her — you're bedder at fighding dem dan I ab —\" He stood up and seized one of Hermione's arms, glared at Harry, who hesitated, then grabbed the other and helped hoist Hermione's limp form over Neville's shoulders. \"Wait,\" said Harry, snatching up Hermione's wand from the floor and shoving it into Nevilles hand, \"you'd better take this. . . .\" Neville kicked aside the broken fragments of his own wand as they walked slowly toward the door. \"My gran's going do kill be,\" said Neville thickly, blood spattering from his nose as he spoke, \"dat was by dad's old wand. . . .\" Harry stuck his head out of the door and looked around cautiously. The baby-headed Death Eater was screaming and banging into things, toppling grandfather clocks and overturning desks, bawling and confused, while the glass cabinet that Harry now suspected had contained Time-Turners continued to fall, shatter, and repair itself on the wall behind them. \"He's never going to notice us,\" he whispered. \"C'mon . . . keep close behind me. . . .\" They crept out of the office and back toward the door into the black hallway, which now seemed completely deserted. They walked a few steps forward, Neville tottering slightly due to Hermione's weight. The door of the Time Room swung shut behind them, and the walls began to rotate once more. The recent blow on the back of Harry's head seemed to have unsteadied him; he narrowed his eyes, swaying slightly, until the walls stopped moving again. With a sinking heart Harry saw that Hermione's fiery crosses had faded from the doors. \"So which way d'you reck — ?\" But before they could make a decision as to which way to try, a door to their right sprang open and three people fell out of it. \"Ron!\" croaked Harry, dashing toward them. \"Ginny — are you all — ?\" \"Harry,\" said Ron, giggling weakly, lurching forward, seizing the front of Harry's robes and gazing at him with unfocused eyes. \"There you are. . . . Ha ha ha . . . You look funny, Harry. . . . You're all messed up. . . . Ron's face was very white and something dark was trickling from the corner of his mouth. Next moment his knees had given way, but he still clutched the front of Harry's robes, so that Harry was pulled into a kind of bow. \"Ginny?\" Harry said fearfully. \"What happened?\" But Ginny shook her head and slid down the wall into a sitting position, panting and holding her ankle. \"I think her ankle's broken, I heard something crack,\" whispered Luna, who was bending over her and who alone seemed to be unhurt. \"Four of them chased us into a dark room full of planets, it was a very odd place, some of the time we were just floating in the dark —\" \"Harry, we saw Uranus up close!\" said Ron, still giggling feebly. \"Get it, Harry? We saw Uranus — ha ha ha —\" A bubble of blood grew at the corner of Ron's mouth and burst. \"Anyway, one of them grabbed Ginny's foot, I used the Reductor Curse and blew up Pluto in his face, but . . .\" Luna gestured hopelessly at Ginny, who was breathing in a very shallow way, her eyes still closed. \"And what about Ron?\" said Harry fearfully, as Ron continued to giggle, still hanging off the front of Harry's robes. \"I don't know what they hit him with,\" said Luna sadly, \"but he's gone a bit funny, I could hardly get him along at all. . . .\" \"Harry,\" said Ron, pulling Harry's ear down to his mouth and still giggling weakly, \"you know who this girl is, Harry? She's Loony . . . Loony Lovegood . . . ha ha ha . . .\" \"We've got to get out of here,\" said Harry firmly. \"Luna, can you help Ginny?\" \"Yes,\" said Luna, sticking her wand behind her ear for safekeeping, putting an arm around Ginny's waist and pulling her up. \"It's only my ankle, I can do it myself!\" said Ginny impatiently, but next moment she had collapsed sideways and grabbed Luna for support. Harry pulled Ron's arm over his shoulder just as, so many months ago, he had pulled Dudley's. He looked around: They had a one-in-twelve chance of getting the exit right the first time — He heaved Ron toward a door; they were within a few feet of it when another door across the hall burst open and three Death Eaters sped into the hall, led by Bellatrix Lestrange. \"There they are!\" she shrieked. Stunning Spells shot across the room: Harry smashed his way through the door ahead, flung Ron unceremoniously from him, and ducked back to help Neville in with Hermione. They were all over the threshold just in time to slam the door against Bellatrix. \"Colloportus!\" shouted Harry, and he heard three bodies slam into the door on the other side. \"It doesn't matter!\" said a man's voice. \"There are other ways in — WE'VE GOT THEM, THEY'RE HERE!\" Harry spun around. They were back in the Brain Room and, sure enough, there were doors all around the walls. He could hear footsteps in the hall behind them as more Death Eaters came running to join the first. \"Luna — Neville — help me!\" The three of them tore around the room, sealing the doors as they went: Harry crashed into a table and rolled over the top of it in his haste to reach the next door. \"Colloportus!\" There were footsteps running along behind the doors; every now and then another heavy body would launch itself against one, so it creaked and shuddered. Luna and Neville were bewitching the doors along the opposite wall — then, as Harry reached the very top of the room, he heard Luna cry, \"Collo — aaaaaaaaargh . . .\" He turned in time to see her flying through the air. Five Death Eaters were surging into the room through the door she had not reached in time; Luna hit a desk, slid over its surface and onto the floor on the other side where she lay sprawled, as still as Hermione. \"Get Potter!\" shrieked Bellatrix, and she ran at him. He dodged her and sprinted back up the room; he was safe as long as they thought they might hit the prophecy — \"Hey!\" said Ron, who had staggered to his feet and was now tottering drunkenly toward Harry, giggling. \"Hey, Harry, there are brains in here, ha ha ha, isn't that weird, Harry?\" \"Ron, get out of the way, get down —\" But Ron had already pointed his wand at the tank. \"Honest, Harry, they're brains — look — Accio Brain!\" The scene seemed momentarily frozen. Harry, Ginny, and Neville and each of the Death Eaters turned in spite of themselves to watch  the top of the tank as a brain burst from the green liquid like a leaping fish. For a moment it seemed suspended in midair, then it soared toward Ron, spinning as it came, and what looked like ribbons of moving images flew from it, unraveling like rolls of film — \"Ha ha ha, Harry, look at it —\" said Ron, watching it disgorge its gaudy innards. \"Harry, come and touch it, bet it's weird —\" \"RON, NO!\" Harry did not know what would happen if Ron touched the tentacles of thought now flying behind the brain, but he was sure it would not be anything good. He darted forward but Ron had already caught the brain in his outstretched hands. The moment they made contact with his skin, the tentacles began wrapping themselves around Ron's arms like ropes. \"Harry, look what's happen — no — no, I don't like it — no, stop — stop —\" But the thin ribbons were spinning around Ron's chest now. He tugged and tore at them as the brain was pulled tight against him like an octopus's body. \"Diffindo!\" yelled Harry, trying to sever the feelers wrapping themselves tightly around Ron before his eyes, but they would not break. Ron fell over, still thrashing against his bonds. \"Harry, it'll suffocate him!\" screamed Ginny, immobilized by her broken ankle on the floor — then a jet of red light flew from one of the Death Eater's wands and hit her squarely in the face. She keeled over sideways and lay there unconscious. \"STUBEFY !\" shouted Neville, wheeling around and waving Hermione's wand at the oncoming Death Eaters. \"STUBEFY, STUBEFY !\" But nothing happened — one of the Death Eaters shot their own Stunning Spell at Neville; it missed him by inches. Harry and Neville were now the only two left fighting the five Death Eaters, two of whom sent streams of silver light like arrows past them that left craters in the wall behind them. Harry ran for it as Bellatrix Lestrange sprinted right at him. Holding the prophecy high above his head he sprinted back up the room; all he could think of doing was to draw the Death Eaters away from the others. It seemed to have worked. They streaked after him, knocking chairs and tables flying but not daring to bewitch him in case they hurt the prophecy, and he dashed through the only door still open, the one through which the Death Eaters themselves had come. Inwardly praying that Neville would stay with Ron — find some way of releasing him — he ran a few feet into the new room and felt the floor vanish — He was falling down steep stone step after steep stone step, bouncing on every tier until at last, with a crash that knocked all the breath out of his body, he landed flat on his back in the sunken pit where the stone archway stood on its dais. The whole room was ringing with the Death Eaters' laughter. He looked up and saw the five who had been in the Brain Room descending toward him, while as many more emerged through other doorways and began leaping from bench to bench toward him. Harry got to his feet though his legs were trembling so badly they barely supported him. The prophecy was still miraculously unbroken in his left hand, his wand clutched tightly in his right. He backed away, looking around, trying to keep all the Death Eaters within his sights. The back of his legs hit something solid; he had reached the dais where the archway stood. He climbed backward onto it. The Death Eaters all halted, gazing at him. Some were panting as hard as he was. One was bleeding badly; Dolohov, freed of the full Body-Bind, was leering, his wand pointing straight at Harry's face. \"Potter, your race is run,\" drawled Lucius Malfoy, pulling off his mask. \"Now hand me the prophecy like a good boy. . . .\" \"Let — let the others go, and I'll give it to you!\" said Harry desperately. A few of the Death Eaters laughed. \"You are not in a position to bargain, Potter,\" said Lucius Malfoy, his pale face flushed with pleasure. \"You see, there are ten of us and only one of you . . . or hasn't Dumbledore ever taught you how to count?\" \"He's dot alone!\" shouted a voice from above them. \"He's still god be!\" Harry's heart sank. Neville was scrambling down the stone benches toward them, Hermione's wand held fast in his trembling hand. \"Neville — no — go back to Ron —\" \"STUBEFY !\" Neville shouted again, pointing his wand at each Death Eater in turn, \"STUBEFY ! STUBE —\" One of the largest Death Eaters seized Neville from behind, pinioning his arms to his sides. He struggled and kicked; several of the Death Eaters laughed. \"It's Longbottom, isn't it?\" sneered Lucius Malfoy. \"Well, your grandmother is used to losing family members to our cause. . . . Your death will not come as a great shock. . . .\" \"Longbottom?\" repeated Bellatrix, and a truly evil smile lit her gaunt face. \"Why, I have had the pleasure of meeting your parents, boy. . . .\" \"I DOE YOU HAB!\" roared Neville, and he fought so hard against his captor's encircling grip that the Death Eater shouted, \"Someone Stun him!\" \"No, no, no,\" said Bellatrix. She looked transported, alive with excitement as she glanced at Harry, then back at Neville. \"No, let's see how long Longbottom lasts before he cracks like his parents. . . . Unless Potter wants to give us the prophecy —\" \"DON'D GIB ID DO DEM!\" roared Neville, who seemed beside himself, kicking and writhing as Bellatrix drew nearer to him and his captor, her wand raised. \"DON'D GIB ID DO DEM, HARRY!\" Bellatrix raised her wand. \"Crucio!\" Neville screamed, his legs drawn up to his chest so that the Death Eater holding him was momentarily holding him off the ground. The Death Eater dropped him and he fell to the floor, twitching and screaming in agony. \"That was just a taster!\" said Bellatrix, raising her wand so that Neville's screams stopped and he lay sobbing at her feet. She turned and gazed up at Harry. \"Now, Potter, either give us the prophecy, or watch your little friend die the hard way!\" Harry did not have to think; there was no choice. The prophecy was hot with the heat from his clutching hand as he held it out. Malfoy jumped forward to take it. Then, high above them, two more doors burst open and five more people sprinted into the room: Sirius, Lupin, Moody, Tonks, and Kingsley. Malfoy turned and raised his wand, but Tonks had already sent a Stunning Spell right at him. Harry did not wait to see whether it had made contact, but dived off the dais out of the way. The Death Eaters were completely distracted by the appearance of the members of the Order, who were now raining spells down upon them as they jumped from step to step toward the sunken floor: Through the darting bodies, the flashes of light, Harry could see Neville crawling along. He dodged another jet of red light and flung himself flat on the ground to reach Neville. \"Are you okay?\" he yelled, as another spell soared inches over their heads. \"Yes,\" said Neville, trying to pull himself up. \"And Ron?\" \"I dink he's all right — he was still fighding the brain when I left —\" The stone floor between them exploded as a spell hit it, leaving a crater right where Neville's hand had been seconds before. Both scrambled away from the spot, then a thick arm came out of nowhere, seized Harry around the neck and pulled him upright, so that his toes were barely touching the floor. \"Give it to me,\" growled a voice in his ear, \"give me the prophecy —\" The man was pressing so tightly on Harry's windpipe that he could not breathe — through watering eyes he saw Sirius dueling with a Death Eater some ten feet away. Kingsley was fighting two at once; Tonks, still halfway up the tiered seats, was firing spells down at Bellatrix — nobody seemed to realize that Harry was dying. . . . He turned his wand backward toward the man's side, but had no breath to utter an incantation, and the man's free hand was groping toward the hand in which Harry was grasping the prophecy — \"AARGH!\" Neville had come lunging out of nowhere: Unable to articulate a spell, he had jabbed Hermione's wand hard into the eyehole of the Death Eater's mask. The man relinquished Harry at once with a howl of pain and Harry whirled around to face him and gasped, \"STUPEFY !\" The Death Eater keeled over backward and his mask slipped off. It was Macnair, Buckbeak's would-be killer, one of his eyes now swollen and bloodshot. \"Thanks!\" Harry said to Neville, pulling him aside as Sirius and his Death Eater lurched past, dueling so fiercely that their wands were blurs. Then Harry's foot made contact with something round and hard and he slipped — for a moment he thought he had dropped the prophecy, then saw Moody's magic eye spinning away across the floor. Its owner was lying on his side, bleeding from the head, and his attacker was now bearing down upon Harry and Neville: Dolohov, his long pale face twisted with glee. \"Tarantallegra!\" he shouted, his wand pointing at Neville, whose legs went immediately into a kind of frenzied tap dance, unbalancing him and causing him to fall to the floor again. \"Now, Potter —\" He made the same slashing movement with his wand that he had used on Hermione just as Harry yelled, \"Protego!\" Harry felt something streak across his face like a blunt knife but the force of it knocked him sideways, and he fell over Neville's jerking legs, but the Shield Charm had stopped the worst of the spell. Dolohov raised his wand again. \"Accio Proph —\" Sirius hurtled out of nowhere, rammed Dolohov with his shoulder, and sent him flying out of the way. The prophecy had again flown to the tips of Harry's fingers but he had managed to cling to it. Now Sirius and Dolohov were dueling, their wands flashing like swords, sparks flying from their wand tips — Dolohov drew back his wand to make the same slashing movement he had used on Harry and Hermione. Springing up, Harry yelled, \"Petrificus Totalus!\" Once again, Dolohov's arms and legs snapped together and he keeled over backward, landing with a crash on his back. \"Nice one!\" shouted Sirius, forcing Harry's head down as a pair of Stunning Spells flew toward them. \"Now I want you to get out of —\" They both ducked again. A jet of green light had narrowly missed Sirius; across the room Harry saw Tonks fall from halfway up the stone steps, her limp form toppling from stone seat to stone seat, and Bellatrix, triumphant, running back toward the fray. \"Harry, take the prophecy, grab Neville, and run!\" Sirius yelled, dashing to meet Bellatrix. Harry did not see what happened next: Kingsley swayed across his field of vision, battling with the pockmarked Rookwood, now mask-less; another jet of green light flew over Harry's head as he launched himself toward Neville — \"Can you stand?\" he bellowed in Neville's ear, as Neville's legs jerked and twitched uncontrollably. \"Put your arm round my neck —\" Neville did so — Harry heaved — Neville's legs were still flying in every direction, they would not support him and then, out of nowhere, a man lunged at them. Both fell backward, Neville's legs waving wildly like an overturned beetle's, Harry with his left arm held up in the air to try and save the small glass ball from being smashed. \"The prophecy, give me the prophecy, Potter!\" snarled Lucius Malfoy's voice in his ear, and Harry felt the tip of Malfoy's wand pressing hard between his ribs. \"No — get — off — me . . . Neville — catch it!\" Harry flung the prophecy across the floor, Neville spun himself around on his back and scooped the ball to his chest. Malfoy pointed the wand instead at Neville, but Harry jabbed his own wand back over his shoulder and yelled, \"Impedimenta!\" Malfoy was blasted off his back. As Harry scrambled up again he looked around and saw Malfoy smash into the dais on which Sirius and Bellatrix were now dueling. Malfoy aimed his wand at Harry and Neville again, but before he could draw breath to strike, Lupin had jumped between them. \"Harry, round up the others and GO!\" Harry seized Neville by the shoulder of his robes and lifted him bodily onto the first tier of stone steps. Neville's legs twitched and jerked and would not support his weight. Harry heaved again with all the strength he possessed and they climbed another step — A spell hit the stone bench at Harry's heel. It crumbled away and he fell back to the step below: Neville sank to the ground, his legs still jerking and thrashing, and thrust the prophecy into his pocket. \"Come on!\" said Harry desperately, hauling at Neville's robes. \"Just try and push with your legs —\" He gave another stupendous heave and Neville's robes tore all along the left seam — the small spun-glass ball dropped from his pocket and before either of them could catch it, one of Neville's floundering feet kicked it. It flew some ten feet to their right and smashed on the step beneath them. As both of them stared at the place where it had broken, appalled at what had happened, a pearly-white figure with  hugely magnified eyes rose into the air, unnoticed by any but them. Harry could see its mouth moving, but in all the crashes and screams and yells surrounding them, not one word of the prophecy could he hear. The figure stopped speaking and dissolved into nothingness. \"Harry, I'b sorry!\" cried Neville, his face anguished as his legs continued to flounder, \"I'b so sorry, Harry, I didn'd bean do —\" \"It doesn't matter!\" Harry shouted. \"Just try and stand, let's get out of —\" \"Dubbledore!\" said Neville, his sweaty face suddenly transported, staring over Harry's shoulder. \"What?\" \"DUBBLEDORE!\" Harry turned to look where Neville was staring. Directly above them, framed in the doorway from the Brain Room, stood Albus Dumbledore, his wand aloft, his face white and furious. Harry felt a kind of electric charge surge through every particle of his body — they were saved. Dumbledore sped down the steps past Neville and Harry, who had no more thought of leaving. Dumbledore was already at the foot of the steps when the Death Eaters nearest realized he was there. There were yells; one of the Death Eaters ran for it, scrabbling like a monkey up the stone steps opposite. Dumbledore's spell pulled him back as easily and effortlessly as though he had hooked him with an invisible line — Only one couple were still battling, apparently unaware of the new arrival. Harry saw Sirius duck Bellatrix's jet of red light: He was laughing at her. \"Come on, you can do better than that!\" he yelled, his voice echoing around the cavernous room. The second jet of light hit him squarely on the chest. The laughter had not quite died from his face, but his eyes widened in shock. Harry released Neville, though he was unaware of doing so. He was jumping down the steps again, pulling out his wand, as Dumbledore turned to the dais too. It seemed to take Sirius an age to fall. His body curved in a graceful arc as he sank backward through the ragged veil hanging from the arch. . . . And Harry saw the look of mingled fear and surprise on his godfather's wasted, once-handsome face as he fell through the ancient doorway and disappeared behind the veil, which fluttered for a moment as though in a high wind and then fell back into place. Harry heard Bellatrix Lestrange's triumphant scream, but knew it meant nothing — Sirius had only just fallen through the archway, he would reappear from the other side any second. . . . But Sirius did not reappear. \"SIRIUS!\" Harry yelled, \"SIRIUS!\" He had reached the floor, his breath coming in searing gasps. Sirius must be just behind the curtain, he, Harry, would pull him back out again. . . . But as he reached the ground and sprinted toward the dais, Lupin grabbed Harry around the chest, holding him back. \"There's nothing you can do, Harry —\" \"Get him, save him, he's only just gone through!\" \"It's too late, Harry —\" \"We can still reach him —\" Harry struggled hard and viciously, but Lupin would not let go. . . . \"There's nothing you can do, Harry . . . nothing. . . . He's gone.\"\n",

      "Summer was creeping over the grounds around the castle; sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses. But with no Hagrid visible from the castle windows, striding the grounds with Fang at his heels, the scene didn't look right to Harry; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle, where things were so horribly wrong. Harry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione, but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing. \"We're taking no more chances,\" Madam Pomfrey told them severely through a crack in the infirmary door. \"No, I'm sorry, there's every chance the attacker might come back to finish these people off. . . .\" With Dumbledore gone, fear had spread as never before, so that the sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows. There was barely a face to be seen in the school that didn't look worried and tense, and any laughter that rang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled. Harry constantly repeated Dumbledore's final words to himself. \"I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me. . . . Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.\" But what good were these words? Who exactly were they supposed to ask for help, when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were? Hagrid's hint about the spiders was far easier to understand — the trouble was, there didn't seem to be a single spider left in the castle to follow. Harry looked everywhere he went, helped (rather reluctantly) by Ron. They were hampered, of course, by the fact that they weren't allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other Gryffindors. Most of their fellow students seemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by teachers, but Harry found it very irksome. One person, however, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the atmosphere of terror and suspicion. Draco Malfoy was strutting around the school as though he had just been appointed Head Boy. Harry didn't realize what he was so pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and Hagrid had left, when, sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him gloating to Crabbe and Goyle. \"I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dumbledore,\" he said, not troubling to keep his voice down. \"I told you he thinks Dumbledore's the worst headmaster the school's ever  had. Maybe we'll get a decent headmaster now. Someone who won't want the Chamber of Secrets closed. McGonagall won't last long, she's only filling in. . . .\" Snape swept past Harry, making no comment about Hermione's empty seat and cauldron. \"Sir,\" said Malfoy loudly. \"Sir, why don't you apply for the headmaster's job?\" \"Now, now, Malfoy,\" said Snape, though he couldn't suppress a thin-lipped smile. \"Professor Dumbledore has only been suspended by the governors. I daresay he'll be back with us soon enough.\" \"Yeah, right,\" said Malfoy, smirking. \"I expect you'd have Father's vote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the job — I'll tell Father you're the best teacher here, sir —\" Snape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon, fortunately not spotting Seamus Finnigan, who was pretending to vomit into his cauldron. \"I'm quite surprised the Mudbloods haven't all packed their bags by now,\" Malfoy went on. \"Bet you five Galleons the next one dies. Pity it wasn't Granger —\" The bell rang at that moment, which was lucky; at Malfoy's last words, Ron had leapt off his stool, and in the scramble to collect bags and books, his attempts to reach Malfoy went unnoticed. \"Let me at him,\" Ron growled as Harry and Dean hung onto his arms. \"I don't care, I don't need my wand, I'm going to kill him with my bare hands —\" \"Hurry up, I've got to take you all to Herbology,\" barked Snape over the class's heads, and off they marched, with Harry, Ron, and Dean bringing up the rear, Ron still trying to get loose. It was only  safe to let go of him when Snape had seen them out of the castle and they were making their way across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses. The Herbology class was very subdued; there were now two missing from their number, Justin and Hermione. Professor Sprout set them all to work pruning the Abyssinian Shrivelfigs. Harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the compost heap and found himself face-to-face with Ernie Macmillan. Ernie took a deep breath and said, very formally, \"I just want to say, Harry, that I'm sorry I ever suspected you. I know you'd never attack Hermione Granger, and I apologize for all the stuff I said. We're all in the same boat now, and, well —\" He held out a pudgy hand, and Harry shook it. Ernie and his friend Hannah came to work at the same Shrivelfig as Harry and Ron. \"That Draco Malfoy character,\" said Ernie, breaking off dead twigs, \"he seems very pleased about all this, doesn't he? D'you know, I think he might be Slytherin's heir.\" \"That's clever of you,\" said Ron, who didn't seem to have forgiven Ernie as readily as Harry. \"Do you think it's Malfoy, Harry?\" Ernie asked. \"No,\" said Harry, so firmly that Ernie and Hannah stared. A second later, Harry spotted something. Several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side of the glass, moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking the shortest route to a prearranged meeting. Harry hit Ron over the hand with his pruning shears. \"Ouch! What're you —\" Harry pointed out the spiders, following their progress with his eyes screwed up against the sun. \"Oh, yeah,\" said Ron, trying, and failing, to look pleased. \"But we can't follow them now —\" Ernie and Hannah were listening curiously. Harry's eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders. If they pursued their fixed course, there could be no doubt about where they would end up. \"Looks like they're heading for the Forbidden Forest. . . .\" And Ron looked even unhappier about that. At the end of the lesson Professor Sprout escorted the class to their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson. Harry and Ron lagged behind the others so they could talk out of earshot. \"We'll have to use the Invisibility Cloak again,\" Harry told Ron. \"We can take Fang with us. He's used to going into the forest with Hagrid, he might be some help.\" \"Right,\" said Ron, who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers. \"Er — aren't there — aren't there supposed to be werewolves in the forest?\" he added as they took their usual places at the back of Lockhart's classroom. Preferring not to answer that question, Harry said, \"There are good things in there, too. The centaurs are all right, and the unicorns . . .\" Ron had never been into the Forbidden Forest before. Harry had entered it only once and had hoped never to do so again. Lockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him. Every other teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual, but Lockhart appeared nothing short of buoyant. \"Come now,\" he cried, beaming around him. \"Why all these long faces?\" People swapped exasperated looks, but nobody answered. \"Don't you people realize,\" said Lockhart, speaking slowly, as though they were all a bit dim, \"the danger has passed! The culprit has been taken away —\" \"Says who?\" said Dean Thomas loudly. \"My dear young man, the Minister of Magic wouldn't have taken Hagrid if he hadn't been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty,\" said Lockhart, in the tone of someone explaining that one and one made two. \"Oh, yes he would,\" said Ron, even more loudly than Dean. \"I flatter myself I know a touch more about Hagrid's arrest than you do, Mr. Weasley,\" said Lockhart in a self-satisfied tone. Ron started to say that he didn't think so, somehow, but stopped in midsentence when Harry kicked him hard under the desk. \"We weren't there, remember?\" Harry muttered. But Lockhart's disgusting cheeriness, his hints that he had always thought Hagrid was no good, his confidence that the whole business was now at an end, irritated Harry so much that he yearned to throw Gadding with Ghouls right in Lockhart's stupid face. Instead he contented himself with scrawling a note to Ron: Let's do it tonight. Ron read the message, swallowed hard, and looked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by Hermione. The sight seemed to stiffen his resolve, and he nodded. The Gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days, because from six o'clock onward the Gryffindors had nowhere else to go. They also had plenty to talk about, with the result that the common room often didn't empty until past midnight. Harry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right after dinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room to clear. Fred and George challenged Harry and Ron to a few games of Exploding Snap, and Ginny sat watching them, very subdued in Hermione's usual chair. Harry and Ron kept losing on purpose, trying to finish the games quickly, but even so, it was well past midnight when Fred, George, and Ginny finally went to bed. Harry and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak, throwing it over themselves, and climbing through the portrait hole. It was another difficult journey through the castle, dodging all the teachers. At last they reached the entrance hall, slid back the lock on the oak front doors, squeezed between them, trying to stop any creaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds. \"'Course,\" said Ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass, \"we might get to the forest and find there's nothing to follow. Those spiders might not've been going there at all. I know it looked like they were moving in that sort of general direction, but . . .\" His voice trailed away hopefully. They reached Hagrid's house, sad and sorry-looking with its blank windows. When Harry pushed the door open, Fang went mad with joy at the sight of them. Worried he might wake everyone at the castle with his deep, booming barks, they hastily fed him treacle toffee from a tin on the mantelpiece, which glued his teeth together. Harry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid's table. There would be no need for it in the pitch-dark forest. \"C'mon, Fang, we're going for a walk,\" said Harry, patting his leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the edge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree. Harry took out his wand, murmured, \"Lumos!\" and a tiny light appeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders. \"Good thinking,\" said Ron. \"I'd light mine, too, but you know — it'd probably blow up or something. . . .\" Harry tapped Ron on the shoulder, pointing at the grass. Two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees. \"Okay,\" Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst, \"I'm ready. Let's go.\" So, with Fang scampering around them, sniffing tree roots and leaves, they entered the forest. By the glow of Harry's wand, they followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path. They walked behind them for about twenty minutes, not speaking, listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves. Then, when the trees had become thicker than ever, so that the stars overhead were no longer visible, and Harry's wand shone alone in the sea of dark, they saw their spider guides leaving the path. Harry paused, trying to see where the spiders were going, but everything outside his little sphere of light was pitch-black. He had never been this deep into the forest before. He could vividly remember Hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time he'd been in here. But Hagrid was miles away now, probably sitting in a cell in Azkaban, and he had also said to follow the spiders. Something wet touched Harry's hand and he jumped backward, crushing Ron's foot, but it was only Fang's nose. \"What d'you reckon?\" Harry said to Ron, whose eyes he could just make out, reflecting the light from his wand. \"We've come this far,\" said Ron. So they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees. They couldn't move very quickly now; there were tree roots and stumps in their way, barely visible in the near blackness. Harry could feel Fang's hot breath on his hand. More than once, they had to stop, so that Harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight. They walked for what seemed like at least half an hour, their robes snagging on low-slung branches and brambles. After a while, they noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward, though the trees were as thick as ever. Then Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making both Harry and Ron jump out of their skins. \"What?\" said Ron loudly, looking around into the pitch-dark, and gripping Harry's elbow very hard. \"There's something moving over there,\" Harry breathed. \"Listen . . . sounds like something big. . . .\" They listened. Some distance to their right, the something big was snapping branches as it carved a path through the trees. \"Oh, no,\" said Ron. \"Oh, no, oh, no, oh —\" \"Shut up,\" said Harry frantically. \"It'll hear you.\" \"Hear me?\" said Ron in an unnaturally high voice. \"It's already heard Fang!\" The darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they  stood, terrified, waiting. There was a strange rumbling noise and then silence. \"What d'you think it's doing?\" said Harry. \"Probably getting ready to pounce,\" said Ron. They waited, shivering, hardly daring to move. \"D'you think it's gone?\" Harry whispered. \"Dunno —\" Then, to their right, came a sudden blaze of light, so bright in the darkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes. Fang yelped and tried to run, but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and yelped even louder. \"Harry!\" Ron shouted, his voice breaking with relief. \"Harry, it's our car!\" \"What?\" \"Come on!\" Harry blundered after Ron toward the light, stumbling and tripping, and a moment later they had emerged into a clearing. Mr. Weasley's car was standing, empty, in the middle of a circle of thick trees under a roof of dense branches, its headlights ablaze. As Ron walked, openmouthed, toward it, it moved slowly toward him, exactly like a large, turquoise dog greeting its owner. \"It's been here all the time!\" said Ron delightedly, walking around the car. \"Look at it. The forest's turned it wild. . . .\" The sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud. Apparently it had taken to trundling around the forest on its own. Fang didn't seem at all keen on it; he kept close to Harry, who could feel him quivering. His breathing slowing down again, Harry stuffed his wand back into his robes. \"And we thought it was going to attack us!\" said Ron, leaning against the car and patting it. \"I wondered where it had gone!\" Harry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders, but they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlights. \"We've lost the trail,\" he said. \"C'mon, let's go and find them.\" Ron didn't speak. He didn't move. His eyes were fixed on a point some ten feet above the forest floor, right behind Harry. His face was livid with terror. Harry didn't even have time to turn around. There was a loud clicking noise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him around the middle and lift him off the ground, so that he was hanging facedown. Struggling, terrified, he heard more clicking, and saw Ron's legs leave the ground, too, heard Fang whimpering and howling — next moment, he was being swept away into the dark trees. Head hanging, Harry saw that what had hold of him was marching on six immensely long, hairy legs, the front two clutching him tightly below a pair of shining black pincers. Behind him, he could hear another of the creatures, no doubt carrying Ron. They were moving into the very heart of the forest. Harry could hear Fang fighting to free himself from a third monster, whining loudly, but Harry couldn't have yelled even if he had wanted to; he seemed to have left his voice back with the car in the clearing. He never knew how long he was in the creature's clutches; he only knew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the leaf-strewn ground was now swarming with spiders. Craning his neck sideways, he realized that they had reached the ridge of  a vast hollow, a hollow that had been cleared of trees, so that the stars shone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes on. Spiders. Not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below. Spiders the size of carthorses, eight-eyed, eight-legged, black, hairy, gigantic. The massive specimen that was carrying Harry made its way down the steep slope toward a misty, domed web in the very center of the hollow, while its fellows closed in all around it, clicking their pincers excitedly at the sight of its load. Harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him. Ron and Fang thudded down next to him. Fang wasn't howling anymore, but cowering silently on the spot. Ron looked exactly like Harry felt. His mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyes were popping. Harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was saying something. It had been hard to tell, because he clicked his pincers with every word he spoke. \"Aragog!\" it called. \"Aragog!\" And from the middle of the misty, domed web, a spider the size of a small elephant emerged, very slowly. There was gray in the black of his body and legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head was milky white. He was blind. \"What is it?\" he said, clicking his pincers rapidly. \"Men,\" clicked the spider who had caught Harry. \"Is it Hagrid?\" said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyes wandering vaguely. \"Strangers,\" clicked the spider who had brought Ron. \"Kill them,\" clicked Aragog fretfully. \"I was sleeping. . . .\" \"We're friends of Hagrid's,\" Harry shouted. His heart seemed to have left his chest to pound in his throat. Click, click, click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow. Aragog paused. \"Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before,\" he said slowly. \"Hagrid's in trouble,\" said Harry, breathing very fast. \"That's why we've come.\" \"In trouble?\" said the aged spider, and Harry thought he heard concern beneath the clicking pincers. \"But why has he sent you?\" Harry thought of getting to his feet but decided against it; he didn't think his legs would support him. So he spoke from the ground, as calmly as he could. \"They think, up at the school, that Hagrid's been setting a — a — something on students. They've taken him to Azkaban.\" Aragog clicked his pincers furiously, and all around the hollow the sound was echoed by the crowd of spiders; it was like applause, except applause didn't usually make Harry feel sick with fear. \"But that was years ago,\" said Aragog fretfully. \"Years and years ago. I remember it well. That's why they made him leave the school. They believed that I was the monster that dwells in what they call the Chamber of Secrets. They thought that Hagrid had opened the Chamber and set me free.\" \"And you . . . you didn't come from the Chamber of Secrets?\" said Harry, who could feel cold sweat on his forehead. \"I!\" said Aragog, clicking angrily. \"I was not born in the castle. I come from a distant land. A traveler gave me to Hagrid when I was an egg. Hagrid was only a boy, but he cared for me, hidden in a cupboard in the castle, feeding me on scraps from the table. Hagrid is my good friend, and a good man. When I was discovered, and blamed for the death of a girl, he protected me. I have lived here in the forest ever since, where Hagrid still visits me. He even found me a wife, Mosag, and you see how our family has grown, all through Hagrid's goodness. . . .\" Harry summoned what remained of his courage. \"So you never — never attacked anyone?\" \"Never,\" croaked the old spider. \"It would have been my instinct, but out of respect for Hagrid, I never harmed a human. The body of the girl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom. I never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which I grew up. Our kind like the dark and the quiet. . . .\" \"But then . . . Do you know what did kill that girl?\" said Harry. \"Because whatever it is, it's back and attacking people again —\" His words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and the rustling of many long legs shifting angrily; large black shapes shifted all around him. \"The thing that lives in the castle,\" said Aragog, \"is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.\" \"What is it?\" said Harry urgently. More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in. \"We do not speak of it!\" said Aragog fiercely. \"We do not name it! I never even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many times.\" Harry didn't want to press the subject, not with the spiders pressing closer on all sides. Aragog seemed to be tired of talking. He was backing slowly into his domed web, but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward Harry and Ron. \"We'll just go, then,\" Harry called desperately to Aragog, hearing leaves rustling behind him. \"Go?\" said Aragog slowly. \"I think not. . . .\" \"But — but —\" \"My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I cannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so willingly into our midst. Good-bye, friend of Hagrid.\" Harry spun around. Feet away, towering above him, was a solid wall of spiders, clicking, their many eyes gleaming in their ugly black heads. Even as he reached for his wand, Harry knew it was no good, there were too many of them, but as he tried to stand, ready to die fighting, a loud, long note sounded, and a blaze of light flamed through the hollow. Mr. Weasley's car was thundering down the slope, headlights glaring, its horn screeching, knocking spiders aside; several were thrown onto their backs, their endless legs waving in the air. The car screeched to a halt in front of Harry and Ron and the doors flew open. \"Get Fang!\" Harry yelled, diving into the front seat; Ron seized the boarhound around the middle and threw him, yelping, into the back of the car — the doors slammed shut — Ron didn't touch the accelerator but the car didn't need him; the engine roared and they were off, hitting more spiders. They sped up the slope, out of the hollow, and they were soon crashing through the forest, branches whipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through the widest gaps, following a path it obviously knew. Harry looked sideways at Ron. His mouth was still open in the silent scream, but his eyes weren't popping anymore. \"Are you okay?\" Ron stared straight ahead, unable to speak. They smashed their way through the undergrowth, Fang howling loudly in the back seat, and Harry saw the side mirror snap off as they squeezed past a large oak. After ten noisy, rocky minutes, the trees thinned, and Harry could again see patches of sky. The car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into the windshield. They had reached the edge of the forest. Fang flung himself at the window in his anxiety to get out, and when Harry opened the door, he shot off through the trees to Hagrid's house, tail between his legs. Harry got out too, and after a minute or so, Ron seemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed, still stiff-necked and staring. Harry gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back into the forest and disappeared from view. Harry went back into Hagrid's cabin to get the Invisibility Cloak. Fang was trembling under a blanket in his basket. When Harry got outside again, he found Ron being violently sick in the pumpkin patch. \"Follow the spiders,\" said Ron weakly, wiping his mouth on his sleeve. \"I'll never forgive Hagrid. We're lucky to be alive.\" \"I bet he thought Aragog wouldn't hurt friends of his,\" said Harry. \"That's exactly Hagrid's problem!\" said Ron, thumping the wall of the cabin. \"He always thinks monsters aren't as bad as they're made out, and look where it's got him! A cell in Azkaban!\" He was shivering uncontrollably now. \"What was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out, I'd like to know?\" \"That Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets,\" said Harry, throwing the cloak over Ron and prodding him in the arm to make him walk. \"He was innocent.\" Ron gave a loud snort. Evidently, hatching Aragog in a cupboard wasn't his idea of being innocent. As the castle loomed nearer Harry twitched the cloak to make sure their feet were hidden, then pushed the creaking front doors ajar. They walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up the marble staircase, holding their breath as they passed corridors where watchful sentries were walking. At last they reached the safety of the Gryffindor common room, where the fire had burned itself into glowing ash. They took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair to their dormitory. Ron fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed. Harry, however, didn't feel very sleepy. He sat on the edge of his fourposter, thinking hard about everything Aragog had said. The creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle, he thought, sounded like a sort of monster Voldemort — even other monsters didn't want to name it. But he and Ron were no closer to finding out what it was, or how it Petrified its victims. Even Hagrid had never known what was in the Chamber of Secrets. Harry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his pillows, watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window. He couldn't see what else they could do. They had hit dead ends everywhere. Riddle had caught the wrong person, the Heir of Slytherin had got off, and no one could tell whether it was the same person, or a different one, who had opened the Chamber this time. There was nobody else to ask. Harry lay down, still thinking about what Aragog had said. He was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last hope occurred to him, and he suddenly sat bolt upright. \"Ron,\" he hissed through the dark, \"Ron —\" Ron woke with a yelp like Fang's, stared wildly around, and saw Harry. \"Ron — that girl who died. Aragog said she was found in a bathroom,\" said Harry, ignoring Neville's snuffling snores from the corner. \"What if she never left the bathroom? What if she's still there?\" Ron rubbed his eyes, frowning through the moonlight. And then he understood, too. \"You don't think — not Moaning Myrtle?\"\n",

      "Harry awoke at half-past five the next morning as abruptly and completely as if somebody had yelled in his ear. For a few moments he lay immobile as the prospect of the hearing filled every tiny particle of his brain, then, unable to bear it, he leapt out of bed and put on his glasses. Mrs. Weasley had laid out his freshly laundered jeans and T-shirt at the foot of his bed. Harry scrambled into them. The blank picture on the wall sniggered again. Ron was lying sprawled on his back with his mouth wide open, fast asleep. He did not stir as Harry crossed the room, stepped out onto the landing, and closed the door softly behind him. Trying not to think of the next time he would see Ron, when they might no longer be fellow students at Hogwarts, Harry walked quietly down the stairs, past the heads of Kreacher's ancestors, and into the kitchen. He had expected it to be empty, but it was not. When he reached the door he heard the soft rumble of voices on the other side and when he pushed it open he saw Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Sirius, Lupin, and Tonks sitting there almost as though they were waiting for him. All were fully dressed except Mrs. Weasley, who was wearing a quilted, purple dressing gown. She leapt to her feet the moment he entered. \"Breakfast,\" she said as she pulled out her wand and hurried over to the fire. \"M-m-morning, Harry,\" yawned Tonks. Her hair was blonde and curly this morning. \"Sleep all right?\" \"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"I've b-b-been up all night,\" she said, with another shuddering yawn. \"Come and sit down. . . .\" She drew out a chair, knocking over the one beside it in the process. \"What do you want, Harry?\" Mrs. Weasley called. \"Porridge? Muffins? Kippers? Bacon and eggs? Toast?\" \"Just — just toast, thanks,\" said Harry. Lupin glanced at Harry, then said to Tonks, \"What were you saying about Scrimgeour?\" \"Oh . . . yeah . . . well, we need to be a bit more careful, he's been asking Kingsley and me funny questions. . . .\" Harry felt vaguely grateful that he was not required to join in the conversation. His insides were squirming. Mrs. Weasley placed a couple of pieces of toast and marmalade in front of him; he tried to eat, but it was like chewing carpet. Mrs. Weasley sat down on his other side and started fussing with his T-shirt, tucking in the label and smoothing out creases across the shoulders. He wished she wouldn't. \". . . and I'll have to tell Dumbledore I can't do night duty tomorrow, I'm just t-t-too tired,\" Tonks finished, yawning hugely again. \"I'll cover for you,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"I'm okay, I've got a report to finish anyway. . . .\" Mr. Weasley was not wearing wizard's robes but a pair of pinstriped trousers and an old bomber jacket. He turned from Tonks to Harry. \"How are you feeling?\" Harry shrugged. \"It'll all be over soon,\" Mr. Weasley said bracingly. \"In a few hours' time you'll be cleared.\" Harry said nothing. \"The hearing's on my floor, in Amelia Bones's office. She's Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and she's the one who'll be questioning you.\" \"Amelia Bones is okay, Harry,\" said Tonks earnestly. \"She's fair, she'll hear you out.\" Harry nodded, still unable to think of anything to say. \"Don't lose your temper,\" said Sirius abruptly. \"Be polite and stick to the facts.\" Harry nodded again. \"The law's on your side,\" said Lupin quietly. \"Even underage wizards are allowed to use magic in life-threatening situations.\" Something very cold trickled down the back of Harry's neck; for a moment he thought someone was putting a Disillusionment Charm on him again, then he realized that Mrs. Weasley was attacking his hair with a wet comb. She pressed hard on the top of his head. \"Doesn't it ever lie flat?\" she said desperately. Harry shook his head. Mr. Weasley checked his watch and looked up at Harry. \"I think we'll go now,\" he said. \"We're a bit early, but I think you'll be better off there than hanging around here.\" \"Okay,\" said Harry automatically, dropping his toast and getting to his feet. \"You'll be all right, Harry,\" said Tonks, patting him on the arm. \"Good luck,\" said Lupin. \"I'm sure it will be fine.\" \"And if it's not,\" said Sirius grimly, \"I'll see to Amelia Bones for you. . . .\" Harry smiled weakly. Mrs. Weasley hugged him. \"We've all got our fingers crossed,\" she said. \"Right,\" said Harry. \"Well . . . see you later then.\" He followed Mr. Weasley upstairs and along the hall. He could hear Sirius's mother grunting in her sleep behind her curtains. Mr. Weasley unbolted the door and they stepped out into the cold, gray dawn. \"You don't normally walk to work, do you?\" Harry asked him, as they set off briskly around the square. \"No, I usually Apparate,\" said Mr. Weasley, \"but obviously you can't, and I think it's best we arrive in a thoroughly non-magical fashion . . . makes a better impression, given what you're being disciplined for. . . .\" Mr. Weasley kept his hand inside his jacket as they walked. Harry knew it was clenched around his wand. The run-down streets were almost deserted, but when they arrived at the miserable little Underground station they found it already full of early morning commuters. As ever when he found himself in close proximity to Muggles going about their daily business, Mr. Weasley was hard put to contain his enthusiasm. \"Simply fabulous,\" he whispered, indicating the automatic ticket machines. \"Wonderfully ingenious.\" \"They're out of order,\" said Harry, pointing at the sign. \"Yes, but even so . . .\" said Mr. Weasley, beaming fondly at them. They bought their tickets instead from a sleepy-looking guard (Harry handled the transaction, as Mr. Weasley was not very good with Muggle money) and five minutes later they were boarding an Underground train that rattled them off toward the center of London. Mr. Weasley kept anxiously checking and rechecking the Underground map above the windows. \"Four stops, Harry . . . three stops left now . . . two stops to go, Harry . . .\" They got off at a station in the very heart of London, swept from the train in a tide of besuited men and women carrying briefcases. Up  the escalator they went, through the ticket barrier (Mr. Weasley delighted with the way the stile swallowed his ticket), and emerged onto a broad street lined with imposing-looking buildings, already full of traffic. \"Where are we?\" said Mr. Weasley blankly, and for one heart-stopping moment Harry thought they had gotten off at the wrong station despite Mr. Weasley's continual references to the map; but a second later he said, \"Ah yes . . . this way, Harry,\" and led him down a side road. \"Sorry,\" he said, \"but I never come by train and it all looks rather different from a Muggle perspective. As a matter of fact I've never even used the visitor's entrance before.\" The farther they walked, the smaller and less imposing the buildings became, until finally they reached a street that contained several rather shabby-looking offices, a pub, and an overflowing dumpster. Harry had expected a rather more impressive location for the Ministry of Magic. \"Here we are,\" said Mr. Weasley brightly, pointing at an old red telephone box, which was missing several panes of glass and stood before a heavily graffittied wall. \"After you, Harry.\" He opened the telephone box door. Harry stepped inside, wondering what on earth this was about. Mr. Weasley folded himself in beside Harry and closed the door. It was a tight fit; Harry was jammed against the telephone apparatus, which was hanging crookedly from the wall as though a vandal had tried to rip it off. Mr. Weasley reached past Harry for the receiver. \"Mr. Weasley, I think this might be out of order too,\" Harry said. \"No, no, I'm sure it's fine,\" said Mr. Weasley, holding the receiver above his head and peering at the dial. \"Let's see . . . six . . .\" he dialed the number, \"two . . . four . . . and another four . . . and another two . . .\" As the dial whirred smoothly back into place, a cool female voice sounded inside the telephone box, not from the receiver in Mr. Weasley's hand, but as loudly and plainly as though an invisible woman were standing right beside them. \"Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and business.\" \"Er . . .\" said Mr. Weasley, clearly uncertain whether he should talk into the receiver or not; he compromised by holding the mouthpiece to his ear, \"Arthur Weasley, Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, here to escort Harry Potter, who has been asked to attend a disciplinary hearing. . . .\" \"Thank you,\" said the cool female voice. \"Visitor, please take the badge and attach it to the front of your robes.\" There was a click and a rattle, and Harry saw something slide out of the metal chute where returned coins usually appeared. He picked it up: It was a square silver badge with Harry Potter, Disciplinary Hearing on it. He pinned it to the front of his T-shirt as the female voice spoke again. \"Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium.\" The floor of the telephone box shuddered. They were sinking slowly into the ground. Harry watched apprehensively as the pavement rose up past the glass windows of the telephone box until darkness closed over their heads. Then he could see nothing at all; he could only hear a dull grinding noise as the telephone box made its way down through the earth. After about a minute, though it felt much longer to Harry, a chink of golden light illuminated his feet and, widening, rose up his body, until it hit him in the face and he had to blink to stop his eyes from watering. \"The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant day,\" said the woman's voice. The door of the telephone box sprang open and Mr. Weasley stepped out of it, followed by Harry, whose mouth had fallen open. They were standing at one end of a very long and splendid hall with a highly polished, dark wood floor. The peacock-blue ceiling was inlaid with gleaming golden symbols that were continually moving and changing like some enormous heavenly notice board. The walls on each side were paneled in shiny dark wood and had many gilded fireplaces set into them. Every few seconds a witch or wizard would emerge from one of the left-hand fireplaces with a soft whoosh; on the right-hand side, short queues of wizards were forming before each fireplace, waiting to depart. Halfway down the hall was a fountain. A group of golden statues, larger than life-size, stood in the middle of a circular pool. Tallest of them all was a noble-looking wizard with his wand pointing straight up in the air. Grouped around him were a beautiful witch, a centaur, a goblin, and a house-elf. The last three were all looking adoringly up at the witch and wizard. Glittering jets of water were flying from the ends of the two wands, the point of the centaur's arrow, the tip of the goblin's hat, and each of the house-elf's ears, so that the tinkling hiss of falling water was added to the pops and cracks of Apparators and the clatter of footsteps as hundreds of witches and wizards, most of whom were wearing glum, early-morning looks, strode toward a set of golden gates at the far end of the hall. \"This way,\" said Mr. Weasley. They joined the throng, wending their way between the Ministry workers, some of whom were carrying tottering piles of parchment, others battered briefcases, still others reading the Daily Prophet as they walked. As they passed the fountain Harry saw silver Sickles and bronze Knuts glinting up at him from the bottom of the pool. A small, smudged sign beside it read: All proceeds from the Fountain of Magical Brethren will be given to St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries If I'm not expelled from Hogwarts, I'll put in ten Galleons, Harry found himself thinking desperately. \"Over here, Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley, and they stepped out of the stream of Ministry employees heading for the golden gates, toward a desk on the left, over which hung a sign saying security. A badly shaven wizard in peacock-blue robes looked up as they approached and put down his Daily Prophet. \"I'm escorting a visitor,\" said Mr. Weasley, gesturing toward Harry. \"Step over here,\" said the wizard in a bored voice. Harry walked closer to him and the wizard held up a long golden rod, thin and flexible as a car aerial, and passed it up and down Harry's front and back. \"Wand,\" grunted the security wizard at Harry, putting down the golden instrument and holding out his hand. Harry produced his wand. The wizard dropped it onto a strange brass instrument, which looked something like a set of scales with only one dish. It began to vibrate. A narrow strip of parchment came speeding out of a slit in the base. The wizard tore this off and read the writing upon it. \"Eleven inches, phoenix-feather core, been in use four years. That correct?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry nervously. \"I keep this,\" said the wizard, impaling the slip of parchment on a small brass spike. \"You get this back,\" he added, thrusting the wand at Harry. \"Thank you.\" \"Hang on. . . .\" said the wizard slowly. His eyes had darted from the silver visitor's badge on Harry's chest to his forehead. \"Thank you, Eric,\" said Mr. Weasley firmly, and grasping Harry by the shoulder, he steered him away from the desk and back into the stream of wizards and witches walking through the golden gates. Jostled slightly by the crowd, Harry followed Mr. Weasley through the gates into the smaller hall beyond, where at least twenty lifts stood behind wrought golden grilles. Harry and Mr. Weasley joined the crowd around one of them. A big, bearded wizard holding a large cardboard box stood nearby. The box was emitting rasping noises. \"All right, Arthur?\" said the wizard, nodding at Mr. Weasley. \"What've you got there, Bob?\" asked Mr. Weasley, looking at the box. \"We're not sure,\" said the wizard seriously. \"We thought it was a bog-standard chicken until it started breathing fire. Looks like a serious breach of the Ban on Experimental Breeding to me.\" With a great jangling and clattering a lift descended in front of them; the golden grille slid back and Harry and Mr. Weasley moved inside it with the rest of the crowd. Harry found himself jammed against the back wall of the lift. Several witches and wizards were looking at him curiously; he stared at his feet to avoid catching anyone's eye, flattening his fringe as he did so. The grilles slid shut with a crash and the lift ascended slowly, chains rattling all the while, while the same cool female voice Harry had heard in the telephone box rang out again. \"Level seven, Department of Magical Games and Sports, incorporating the British and Irish Quidditch League Headquarters, Official Gobstones Club, and Ludicrous Patents Office.\" The lift doors opened; Harry glimpsed an untidy-looking corridor, with various posters of Quidditch teams tacked lopsidedly on the walls; one of the wizards in the lift, who was carrying an armful of broomsticks, extricated himself with difficulty and disappeared down the corridor. The doors closed, the lift juddered upward again, and the woman's voice said, \"Level six, Department of Magical Transport, incorporating the Floo Network Authority, Broom Regulatory Control, Portkey Office, and Apparation Test Center.\" Once again the lift doors opened and four or five witches and wizards got out; at the same time, several paper airplanes swooped into the lift. Harry stared up at them as they flapped idly around above his head; they were a pale violet color and he could see ministry of magic stamped along the edges of their wings. \"Just Interdepartmental memos,\" Mr. Weasley muttered to him. \"We used to use owls, but the mess was unbelievable . . . droppings all over the desks . . .\" As they clattered upward again, the memos flapped around the swaying lamp in the lift's ceiling. \"Level five, Department of International Magical Cooperation, incorporating the International Magical Trading Standards Body, the International Magical Office of Law, and the International Confederation of Wizards, British Seats.\" When the doors opened, two of the memos zoomed out with a few more witches and wizards, but several more memos zoomed in, so that the light from the lamp in the ceiling flickered and flashed as they darted around it. \"Level four, Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being, and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison Office, and Pest Advisory Bureau.\" \" 'S'cuse,\" said the wizard carrying the fire-breathing chicken and he left the lift pursued by a little flock of memos. The doors clanged shut yet again. \"Level three, Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, including the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad, Obliviator Headquarters, and Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee.\" Everybody left the lift on this floor except Mr. Weasley, Harry, and a witch who was reading an extremely long piece of parchment that was trailing on the ground. The remaining memos continued to soar around the lamp as the lift juddered upward again, and then the doors opened and the voice said, \"Level two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror Headquarters, and Wizengamot Administration Services.\" \"This is us, Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley, and they followed the witch out of the lift into a corridor lined with doors. \"My office is on the other side of the floor.\" \"Mr. Weasley,\" said Harry, as they passed a window through which sunlight was streaming, \"aren't we underground?\" \"Yes, we are,\" said Mr. Weasley, \"those are enchanted windows; Magical Maintenance decide what weather we're getting every day. We had two months of hurricanes last time they were angling for a pay raise. . . . Just round here, Harry.\" They turned a corner, walked through a pair of heavy oak doors, and emerged in a cluttered, open area divided into cubicles, which were buzzing with talk and laughter. Memos were zooming in and out of cubicles like miniature rockets. A lopsided sign on the nearest cubicle read auror headquarters. Harry looked surreptitiously through the doorways as they passed. The Aurors had covered their cubicle walls with everything from pictures of wanted wizards and photographs of their families, to posters of their favorite Quidditch teams and articles from the Daily Prophet. A scarlet-robed man with a ponytail longer than Bill's was sitting with his boots up on his desk, dictating a report to his quill. A little farther along, a witch with a patch over her eye was talking over the top of her cubicle wall to Kingsley Shacklebolt. \"Morning, Weasley,\" said Kingsley carelessly, as they drew nearer. \"I've been wanting a word with you, have you got a second?\" \"Yes, if it really is a second,\" said Mr. Weasley, \"I'm in rather a hurry.\" They were talking to each other as though they hardly knew each other, and when Harry opened his mouth to say hello to Kingsley, Mr. Weasley stood on his foot. They followed Kingsley along the row and into the very last cubicle. Harry received a slight shock; Sirius's face was blinking down at him from every direction. Newspaper cuttings and old photographs — even the one of Sirius being best man at the Potters' wedding — papered the walls. The only Sirius-free space was a map of the world in which little red pins were glowing like jewels. \"Here,\" said Kingsley brusquely to Mr. Weasley, shoving a sheaf of parchment into his hand, \"I need as much information as possible on flying Muggle vehicles sighted in the last twelve months. We've received information that Black might still be using his old motorcycle.\" Kingsley tipped Harry an enormous wink and added, in a whisper, \"Give him the magazine, he might find it interesting.\" Then he said in normal tones, \"And don't take too long, Weasley, the delay on that firelegs report held our investigation up for a month.\" \"If you had read my report you would know that the term is 'firearms,' \" said Mr. Weasley coolly. \"And I'm afraid you'll have to wait for information on motorcycles, we're extremely busy at the moment.\" He dropped his voice and said, \"If you can get away before seven, Molly's making meatballs.\" He beckoned to Harry and led him out of Kingsley's cubicle, through a second set of oak doors, into another passage, turned left, marched along another corridor, turned right into a dimly lit and distinctly shabby corridor, and finally reached a dead end, where a door on the left stood ajar, revealing a broom cupboard, and a door on the right bore a tarnished brass plaque reading misuse of muggle artifacts. Mr. Weasley's dingy office seemed to be slightly smaller than the broom cupboard. Two desks had been crammed inside it and there was barely room to move around them because of all the overflowing filing cabinets lining the walls, on top of which were tottering piles of files. The little wall space available bore witness to Mr. Weasley's obsessions; there were several posters of cars, including one of a dismantled engine, two illustrations of postboxes he seemed to have cut out of Muggle children's books, and a diagram showing how to wire a plug. Sitting on top of Mr. Weasley's overflowing in-tray was an old toaster that was hiccuping in a disconsolate way and a pair of empty leather gloves that were twiddling their thumbs. A photograph of the Weasley family stood beside the in-tray. Harry noticed that Percy appeared to have walked out of it. \"We haven't got a window,\" said Mr. Weasley apologetically, taking off his bomber jacket and placing it on the back of his chair. \"We've asked, but they don't seem to think we need one. Have a seat, Harry, doesn't look as if Perkins is in yet.\" Harry squeezed himself into the chair behind Perkins's desk while Mr. Weasley rifled through the sheaf of parchment Kingsley Shackle-bolt had given him. \"Ah,\" he said, grinning, as he extracted a copy of a magazine entitled The Quibbler from its midst, \"yes . . .\" He flicked through it. \"Yes, he's right, I'm sure Sirius will find that very amusing — oh dear, what's this now?\" A memo had just zoomed in through the open door and fluttered to rest on top of the hiccuping toaster. Mr. Weasley unfolded it and read aloud, \" 'Third regurgitating public toilet reported in Bethnal Green, kindly investigate immediately.' This is getting ridiculous. . . .\" \"A regurgitating toilet?\" \"Anti-Muggle pranksters,\" said Mr. Weasley, frowning. \"We had two last week, one in Wimbledon, one in Elephant and Castle. Muggles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disappearing — well, you can imagine. The poor things keep calling in those — those pumbles, I think they're called — you know, the ones who mend pipes and things —\" \"Plumbers?\" \"— exactly, yes, but of course they're flummoxed. I only hope we can catch whoever's doing it.\" \"Will it be Aurors who catch them?\" \"Oh no, this is too trivial for Aurors, it'll be the ordinary Magical Law Enforcement Patrol — ah, Harry, this is Perkins.\" A stooped, timid-looking old wizard with fluffy white hair had just entered the room, panting. \"Oh Arthur!\" he said desperately, without looking at Harry. \"Thank goodness, I didn't know what to do for the best, whether to wait here for you or not, I've just sent an owl to your home but you've obviously missed it — an urgent message came ten minutes ago —\" \"I know about the regurgitating toilet,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"No, no, it's not the toilet, it's the Potter boy's hearing — they've changed the time and venue — it starts at eight o'clock now and it's down in old Courtroom Ten —\" \"Down in old — but they told me — Merlin's beard —\" Mr. Weasley looked at his watch, let out a yelp, and leapt from his chair. \"Quick, Harry, we should have been there five minutes ago!\" Perkins flattened himself against the filing cabinets as Mr. Weasley left the office at a run, Harry on his heels. \"Why have they changed the time?\" Harry said breathlessly as they hurtled past the Auror cubicles; people poked out their heads and stared as they streaked past. Harry felt as though he had left all his insides back at Perkins's desk. \"I've no idea, but thank goodness we got here so early, if you'd missed it it would have been catastrophic!\" Mr. Weasley skidded to a halt beside the lifts and jabbed impatiently at the down button. \"Come ON!\" The lift clattered into view and they hurried inside. Every time it stopped Mr. Weasley cursed furiously and pummelled the number nine button. \"Those courtrooms haven't been used in years,\" said Mr. Weasley angrily. \"I can't think why they're doing it down there — unless — but no . . .\" A plump witch carrying a smoking goblet entered the lift at that moment, and Mr. Weasley did not elaborate. \"The Atrium,\" said the cool female voice and the golden grilles slid open, showing Harry a distant glimpse of the golden statues in the fountain. The plump witch got out and a sallow-skinned wizard with a very mournful face got in. \"Morning, Arthur,\" he said in a sepulchral voice as the lift began to descend. \"Don't often see you down here. . . .\" \"Urgent business, Bode,\" said Mr. Weasley, who was bouncing on the balls of his feet and throwing anxious looks over at Harry. \"Ah, yes,\" said Bode, surveying Harry unblinkingly. \"Of course.\" Harry barely had emotion to spare for Bode, but his unfaltering gaze did not make him feel any more comfortable. \"Department of Mysteries,\" said the cool female voice, and left it at that. \"Quick, Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley as the lift doors rattled open, and they sped up a corridor that was quite different from those above. The walls were bare; there were no windows and no doors apart from a plain black one set at the very end of the corridor. Harry expected them to go through it, but instead Mr. Weasley seized him by the arm and dragged him to the left, where there was an opening leading to a flight of steps. \"Down here, down here,\" panted Mr. Weasley, taking two steps at a time. \"The lift doesn't even come down this far . . . why they're doing it there . . .\" They reached the bottom of the steps and ran along yet another corridor, which bore a great resemblance to that which led to Snape's dungeon at Hogwarts, with rough stone walls and torches in brackets. The doors they passed here were heavy wooden ones with iron bolts and keyholes. \"Courtroom . . . ten . . . I think . . . we're nearly . . . yes.\" Mr. Weasley stumbled to a halt outside a grimy dark door with an immense iron lock and slumped against the wall, clutching at a stitch in his chest. \"Go on,\" he panted, pointing his thumb at the door. \"Get in there.\" \"Aren't — aren't you coming with — ?\" \"No, no, I'm not allowed. Good luck!\" Harry's heart was beating a violent tattoo against his Adam's apple. He swallowed hard, turned the heavy iron door handle, and stepped inside the courtroom.\n",

      "Where was Dumbledore, and what was he doing? Harry caught sight of the headmaster only twice over the next few weeks. He rarely appeared at meals anymore, and Harry was sure Hermione was right in thinking that he was leaving the school for days at a time. Had Dumbledore forgotten the lessons he was supposed to be giving Harry? Dumbledore had said that the lessons were leading to something to do with the prophecy; Harry had felt bolstered, comforted, and now he felt slightly abandoned. Halfway through October came their first trip of the term to Hogsmeade. Harry had wondered whether these trips would still be allowed, given the increasingly tight security measures around the school, but was pleased to know that they were going ahead; it was always good to get out of the castle grounds for a few hours. Harry woke early on the morning of the trip, which was proving stormy, and whiled away the time until breakfast by reading his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. He did not usually lie in bed reading his textbooks; that sort of behavior, as Ron rightly said, was indecent in anybody except Hermione, who was simply weird that way. Harry felt, however, that the Half-Blood Prince's copy of Advanced Potion-Making hardly qualified as a textbook. The more Harry pored over the book, the more he realized how much was in there, not only the handy hints and shortcuts on potions that were earning him such a glowing reputation with Slughorn, but also the imaginative little jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins, which Harry was sure, judging by the crossings-out and revisions, that the Prince had invented himself. Harry had already attempted a few of the Prince's self-invented spells. There had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which he had twice used, to general applause, on an unsuspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful of all, Muffliato, a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class without being overheard. The only person who did not find these charms amusing was Hermione, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and refused to talk at all if Harry had used the Muffliato spell on anyone in the vicinity. Sitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so as to examine more closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the Prince some trouble. There were many crossings-out and alterations, but finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble: Levicorpus (nvbl) While the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows, and Neville snored loudly, Harry stared at the letters in brackets. Nvbl . . . that had to mean \"nonverbal.\" Harry rather doubted he would be able to bring off this particular spell; he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells, something Snape had been quick to comment on in every D.A.D.A. class. On the other hand, the Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than Snape so far. Pointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward flick and said Levicorpus! inside his head. \"Aaaaaaaargh!\" There was a flash of light and the room was full of voices: Everyone had woken up as Ron had let out a yell. Harry sent Advanced Potion-Making flying in panic; Ron was dangling upside down in midair as though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the ankle. \"Sorry!\" yelled Harry, as Dean and Seamus roared with laughter, and Neville picked himself up from the floor, having fallen out of bed. \"Hang on — I'll let you down —\" He groped for the potion book and riffled through it in a panic, trying to find the right page; at last he located it and deciphered one cramped word underneath the spell: Praying that this was the counter-jinx, Harry thought Liberacorpus! with all his might. There was another flash of light, and Ron fell in a heap onto his mattress. \"Sorry,\" repeated Harry weakly, while Dean and Seamus continued to roar with laughter. \"Tomorrow,\" said Ron in a muffled voice, \"I'd rather you set the alarm clock.\" By the time they had got dressed, padding themselves out with several of Mrs. Weasley's hand-knitted sweaters and carrying cloaks, scarves, and gloves, Ron's shock had subsided and he had decided that Harry's new spell was highly amusing; so amusing, in fact, that he lost no time in regaling Hermione with the story as they sat down for breakfast. \". . . and then there was another flash of light and I landed on the bed again!\" Ron grinned, helping himself to sausages. Hermione had not cracked a smile during this anecdote, and now turned an expression of wintry disapproval upon Harry. \"Was this spell, by any chance, another one from that potion book of yours?\" she asked. Harry frowned at her. \"Always jump to the worst conclusion, don't you?\" \"Was it?\" \"Well . . . yeah, it was, but so what?\" \"So you just decided to try out an unknown, handwritten incantation and see what would happen?\" \"Why does it matter if it's handwritten?\" said Harry, preferring not to answer the rest of the question. \"Because it's probably not Ministry of Magic&ndash;approved,\" said Hermione. \"And also,\" she added, as Harry and Ron rolled their eyes, \"because I'm starting to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy.\" Both Harry and Ron shouted her down at once. \"It was a laugh!\" said Ron, upending a ketchup bottle over his sausages. \"Just a laugh, Hermione, that's all!\" \"Dangling people upside down by the ankle?\" said Hermione. \"Who puts their time and energy into making up spells like that?\" \"Fred and George,\" said Ron, shrugging, \"it's their kind of thing. And, er —\" \"My dad,\" said Harry. He had only just remembered. \"What?\" said Ron and Hermione together. \"My dad used this spell,\" said Harry. \"I — Lupin told me.\" This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use the spell on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that particular excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a wonderful possibility occurred to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince possibly be — ? \"Maybe your dad did use it, Harry,\" said Hermione, \"but he's not the only one. We've seen a whole bunch of people use it, in case you've forgotten. Dangling people in the air. Making them float along, asleep, helpless.\" Harry stared at her. With a sinking feeling, he too remembered the behavior of the Death Eaters at the Quidditch World Cup. Ron came to his aid. \"That was different,\" he said robustly. \"They were abusing it. Harry and his dad were just having a laugh. You don't like the Prince, Hermione,\" he added, pointing a sausage at her sternly, \"because he's better than you at Potions —\" \"It's got nothing to do with that!\" said Hermione, her cheeks reddening. \"I just think it's very irresponsible to start performing spells when you don't even know what they're for, and stop talking about 'the Prince' as if it's his title, I bet it's just a stupid nickname, and it doesn't seem as though he was a very nice person to me!\" \"I don't see where you get that from,\" said Harry heatedly. \"If he'd been a budding Death Eater he wouldn't have been boasting about being 'half-blood,' would he?\" Even as he said it, Harry remembered that his father had been pure-blood, but he pushed the thought out of his mind; he would worry about that later. . . . \"The Death Eaters can't all be pure-blood, there aren't enough pure-blood wizards left,\" said Hermione stubbornly. \"I expect most of them are half-bloods pretending to be pure. It's only Muggleborns they hate, they'd be quite happy to let you and Ron join up.\" \"There is no way they'd let me be a Death Eater!\" said Ron indignantly, a bit of sausage flying off the fork he was now brandishing at Hermione and hitting Ernie Macmillan on the head. \"My whole family are blood traitors! That's as bad as Muggle-borns to Death Eaters!\" \"And they'd love to have me,\" said Harry sarcastically. \"We'd be best pals if they didn't keep trying to do me in.\" This made Ron laugh; even Hermione gave a grudging smile, and a distraction arrived in the shape of Ginny. \"Hey, Harry, I'm supposed to give you this.\" It was a scroll of parchment with Harry's name written upon it in familiar thin, slanting writing. \"Thanks, Ginny . . . It's Dumbledore's next lesson!\" Harry told Ron and Hermione, pulling open the parchment and quickly reading its contents. \"Monday evening!\" He felt suddenly light and happy. \"Want to join us in Hogsmeade, Ginny?\" he asked. \"I'm going with Dean — might see you there,\" she replied, waving at them as she left. Filch was standing at the oak front doors as usual, checking off the names of people who had permission to go into Hogsmeade. The process took even longer than normal as Filch was triple-checking everybody with his Secrecy Sensor. \"What does it matter if we're smuggling Dark stuff OUT?\" demanded Ron, eyeing the long thin Secrecy Sensor with apprehension. \"Surely you ought to be checking what we bring back IN?\" His cheek earned him a few extra jabs with the Sensor, and he was still wincing as they stepped out into the wind and sleet. The walk into Hogsmeade was not enjoyable. Harry wrapped his scarf over his lower face; the exposed part soon felt both raw and numb. The road to the village was full of students bent double against the bitter wind. More than once Harry wondered whether they might not have had a better time in the warm common room, and when they finally reached Hogsmeade and saw that Zonko's Joke Shop had been boarded up, Harry took it as confirmation that this trip was not destined to be fun. Ron pointed, with a thickly gloved hand, toward Honeydukes, which was mercifully open, and Harry and Hermione staggered in his wake into the crowded shop. \"Thank God,\" shivered Ron as they were enveloped by warm, toffee-scented air. \"Let's stay here all afternoon.\" \"Harry, m'boy!\" said a booming voice from behind them. \"Oh no,\" muttered Harry. The three of them turned to see Professor Slughorn, who was wearing an enormous furry hat and an overcoat with matching fur collar, clutching a large bag of crystalized pineapple, and occupying at least a quarter of the shop. \"Harry, that's three of my little suppers you've missed now!\" said Slughorn, poking him genially in the chest. \"It won't do, m'boy, I'm determined to have you! Miss Granger loves them, don't you?\" \"Yes,\" said Hermione helplessly, \"they're really —\" \"So why don't you come along, Harry?\" demanded Slughorn. \"Well, I've had Quidditch practice, Professor,\" said Harry, who had indeed been scheduling practices every time Slughorn had sent him a little, violet ribbon-adorned invitation. This strategy meant that Ron was not left out, and they usually had a laugh with Ginny, imagining Hermione shut up with McLaggen and Zabini. \"Well, I certainly expect you to win your first match after all this hard work!\" said Slughorn. \"But a little recreation never hurt anybody. Now, how about Monday night, you can't possibly want to practice in this weather. . . .\" \"I can't, Professor, I've got — er — an appointment with Professor Dumbledore that evening.\" \"Unlucky again!\" cried Slughorn dramatically. \"Ah, well . . . you can't evade me forever, Harry!\" And with a regal wave, he waddled out of the shop, taking as little notice of Ron as though he had been a display of Cockroach Clusters. \"I can't believe you've wriggled out of another one,\" said Hermione, shaking her head. \"They're not that bad, you know. . . . They're even quite fun sometimes. . . .\" But then she caught sight of Ron's expression. \"Oh, look — they've got deluxe sugar quills — those would last hours!\" Glad that Hermione had changed the subject, Harry showed much more interest in the new extra-large sugar quills than he would normally have done, but Ron continued to look moody and merely shrugged when Hermione asked him where he wanted to go next. \"Let's go to the Three Broomsticks,\" said Harry. \"It'll be warm.\" They bundled their scarves back over their faces and left the sweetshop. The bitter wind was like knives on their faces after the sugary warmth of Honeydukes. The street was not very busy; nobody was lingering to chat, just hurrying toward their destinations. The exceptions were two men a little ahead of them, standing just outside the Three Broomsticks. One was very tall and thin; squinting through his rain-washed glasses Harry recognized the barman who worked in the other Hogsmeade pub, the Hog's Head. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione drew closer, the barman drew his cloak more tightly around his neck and walked away, leaving the shorter man to fumble with something in his arms. They were barely feet from him when Harry realized who the man was. \"Mundungus!\" The squat, bandy-legged man with long, straggly, ginger hair jumped and dropped an ancient suitcase, which burst open, releasing what looked like the entire contents of a junk shop window. \"Oh, 'ello, 'Arry,\" said Mundungus Fletcher, with a most unconvincing stab at airiness. \"Well, don't let me keep ya.\" And he began scrabbling on the ground to retrieve the contents of his suitcase with every appearance of a man eager to be gone. \"Are you selling this stuff?\" asked Harry, watching Mundungus grab an assortment of grubby-looking objects from the ground. \"Oh, well, gotta scrape a living,\" said Mundungus. \"Gimme that!\" Ron had stooped down and picked up something silver. \"Hang on,\" Ron said slowly. \"This looks familiar —\" \"Thank you!\" said Mundungus, snatching the goblet out of Ron's hand and stuffing it back into the case. \"Well, I'll see you all — OUCH!\" Harry had pinned Mundungus against the wall of the pub by the throat. Holding him fast with one hand, he pulled out his wand. \"Harry!\" squealed Hermione. \"You took that from Sirius's house,\" said Harry, who was almost nose to nose with Mundungus and was breathing in an unpleasant smell of old tobacco and spirits. \"That had the Black family crest on it.\" \"I — no — what — ?\" spluttered Mundungus, who was slowly turning purple. \"What did you do, go back the night he died and strip the place?\" snarled Harry. \"I — no —\" \"Give it to me!\" \"Harry, you mustn't!\" shrieked Hermione, as Mundungus started to turn blue. There was a bang, and Harry felt his hands fly off Mundungus's throat. Gasping and spluttering, Mundungus seized his fallen case, then — CRACK — he Disapparated. Harry swore at the top of his voice, spinning on the spot to see where Mundungus had gone. \"COME BACK, YOU THIEVING — !\" \"There's no point, Harry.\" Tonks had appeared out of nowhere, her mousy hair wet with sleet. \"Mundungus will probably be in London by now. There's no point yelling.\" \"He's nicked Sirius's stuff! Nicked it!\" \"Yes, but still,\" said Tonks, who seemed perfectly untroubled by this piece of information. \"You should get out of the cold.\" She watched them go through the door of the Three Broomsticks. The moment he was inside, Harry burst out, \"He was nicking Sirius's stuff !\" \"I know, Harry, but please don't shout, people are staring,\" whispered Hermione. \"Go and sit down, I'll get you a drink.\" Harry was still fuming when Hermione returned to their table a few minutes later holding three bottles of butterbeer. \"Can't the Order control Mundungus?\" Harry demanded of the other two in a furious whisper. \"Can't they at least stop him stealing everything that's not fixed down when he's at headquarters?\" \"Shh!\" said Hermione desperately, looking around to make sure nobody was listening; there were a couple of warlocks sitting close by who were staring at Harry with great interest, and Zabini was lolling against a pillar not far away. \"Harry, I'd be annoyed too, I know it's your things he's stealing —\" Harry gagged on his butterbeer; he had momentarily forgotten that he owned number twelve, Grimmauld Place. \"Yeah, it's my stuff!\" he said. \"No wonder he wasn't pleased to see me! Well, I'm going to tell Dumbledore what's going on, he's the only one who scares Mundungus.\" \"Good idea,\" whispered Hermione, clearly pleased that Harry was calming down. \"Ron, what are you staring at?\" \"Nothing,\" said Ron, hastily looking away from the bar, but Harry knew he was trying to catch the eye of the curvy and attractive barmaid, Madam Rosmerta, for whom he had long nursed a soft spot. \"I expect 'nothing's' in the back getting more firewhisky,\" said Hermione waspishly. Ron ignored this jibe, sipping his drink in what he evidently considered to be a dignified silence. Harry was thinking about Sirius, and how he had hated those silver goblets anyway. Hermione drummed her fingers on the table, her eyes flickering between Ron and the bar. The moment Harry drained the last drops in his bottle she said, \"Shall we call it a day and go back to school, then?\" The other two nodded; it had not been a fun trip and the weather was getting worse the longer they stayed. Once again they drew their cloaks tightly around them, rearranged their scarves, pulled on their gloves, then followed Katie Bell and a friend out of the pub and back up the High Street. Harry's thoughts strayed to Ginny as they trudged up the road to Hogwarts through the frozen slush. They had not met up with her, undoubtedly, thought Harry, because she and Dean were cozily closeted in Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop, that haunt of happy couples. Scowling, he bowed his head against the swirling sleet and trudged on. It was a little while before Harry became aware that the voices of Katie Bell and her friend, which were being carried back to him on the wind, had become shriller and louder. Harry squinted at their indistinct figures. The two girls were having an argument about something Katie was holding in her hand. \"It's nothing to do with you, Leanne!\" Harry heard Katie say. They rounded a corner in the lane, sleet coming thick and fast, blurring Harry's glasses. Just as he raised a gloved hand to wipe them, Leanne made to grab hold of the package Katie was holding; Katie tugged it back and the package fell to the ground. At once, Katie rose into the air, not as Ron had done, suspended comically by the ankle, but gracefully, her arms outstretched, as though she was about to fly. Yet there was something wrong, something eerie. . . . Her hair was whipped around her by the fierce wind, but her eyes were closed and her face was quite empty of expression. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Leanne had all halted in their tracks, watching. Then, six feet above the ground, Katie let out a terrible scream. Her eyes flew open but whatever she could see, or whatever she was feeling, was clearly causing her terrible anguish. She screamed and screamed; Leanne started to scream too and seized Katie's ankles, trying to tug her back to the ground. Harry, Ron, and Hermione rushed forward to help, but even as they grabbed Katie's legs, she fell on top of them; Harry and Ron managed to catch her but she was writhing so much they could hardly hold her. Instead they lowered her to the ground where she thrashed and screamed, apparently unable to recognize any of them. Harry looked around; the landscape seemed deserted. \"Stay there!\" he shouted at the others over the howling wind. \"I'm going for help!\" He began to sprint toward the school; he had never seen anyone behave as Katie had just behaved and could not think what had caused it; he hurtled around a bend in the lane and collided with what seemed to be an enormous bear on its hind legs. \"Hagrid!\" he panted, disentangling himself from the hedgerow into which he had fallen. \"Harry!\" said Hagrid, who had sleet trapped in his eyebrows and beard, and was wearing his great, shaggy beaverskin coat. \"Jus' bin visitin' Grawp, he's comin' on so well yeh wouldn' —\" \"Hagrid, someone's hurt back there, or cursed, or something —\" \"Wha?\" said Hagrid, bending lower to hear what Harry was saying over the raging wind. \"Someone's been cursed!\" bellowed Harry. \"Cursed? Who's bin cursed — not Ron? Hermione?\" \"No, it's not them, it's Katie Bell — this way . . .\" Together they ran back along the lane. It took them no time to find the little group of people around Katie, who was still writhing and screaming on the ground; Ron, Hermione, and Leanne were all trying to quiet her. \"Get back!\" shouted Hagrid. \"Lemme see her!\" \"Something's happened to her!\" sobbed Leanne. \"I don't know what —\" Hagrid stared at Katie for a second, then without a word, bent down, scooped her into his arms, and ran off toward the castle with her. Within seconds, Katie's piercing screams had died away and the only sound was the roar of the wind. Hermione hurried over to Katie's wailing friend and put an arm around her. \"It's Leanne, isn't it?\" The girl nodded. \"Did it just happen all of a sudden, or — ?\" \"It was when that package tore,\" sobbed Leanne, pointing at the now sodden brown-paper package on the ground, which had split open to reveal a greenish glitter. Ron bent down, his hand outstretched, but Harry seized his arm and pulled him back. \"Don't touch it!\" He crouched down. An ornate opal necklace was visible, poking out of the paper. \"I've seen that before,\" said Harry, staring at the thing. \"It was on display in Borgin and Burkes ages ago. The label said it was cursed. Katie must have touched it.\" He looked up at Leanne, who  had started to shake uncontrollably. \"How did Katie get hold of this?\" \"Well, that's why we were arguing. She came back from the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks holding it, said it was a surprise for somebody at Hogwarts and she had to deliver it. She looked all funny when she said it. . . . Oh no, oh no, I bet she'd been Imperiused and I didn't realize!\" Leanne shook with renewed sobs. Hermione patted her shoulder gently. \"She didn't say who'd given it to her, Leanne?\" \"No . . . she wouldn't tell me . . . and I said she was being stupid and not to take it up to school, but she just wouldn't listen and . . . and then I tried to grab it from her . . . and — and —\" Leanne let out a wail of despair. \"We'd better get up to school,\" said Hermione, her arm still around Leanne. \"We'll be able to find out how she is. Come on. . . .\" Harry hesitated for a moment, then pulled his scarf from around his face and, ignoring Ron's gasp, carefully covered the necklace in it and picked it up. \"We'll need to show this to Madam Pomfrey,\" he said. As they followed Hermione and Leanne up the road, Harry was thinking furiously. They had just entered the grounds when he spoke, unable to keep his thoughts to himself any longer. \"Malfoy knows about this necklace. It was in a case at Borgin and Burkes four years ago, I saw him having a good look at it while I was hiding from him and his dad. This is what he was buying that day when we followed him! He remembered it and he went back for it!\" \"I — I dunno, Harry,\" said Ron hesitantly. \"Loads of people go  to Borgin and Burkes . . . and didn't that girl say Katie got it in the girls' bathroom?\" \"She said she came back from the bathroom with it, she didn't necessarily get it in the bathroom itself —\" \"McGonagall!\" said Ron warningly. Harry looked up. Sure enough, Professor McGonagall was hurrying down the stone steps through swirling sleet to meet them. \"Hagrid says you four saw what happened to Katie Bell — upstairs to my office at once, please! What's that you're holding, Potter?\" \"It's the thing she touched,\" said Harry. \"Good lord,\" said Professor McGonagall, looking alarmed as she took the necklace from Harry. \"No, no, Filch, they're with me!\" she added hastily, as Filch came shuffling eagerly across the entrance hall holding his Secrecy Sensor aloft. \"Take this necklace to Professor Snape at once, but be sure not to touch it, keep it wrapped in the scarf!\" Harry and the others followed Professor McGonagall upstairs and into her office. The sleet-spattered windows were rattling in their frames, and the room was chilly despite the fire crackling in the grate. Professor McGonagall closed the door and swept around her desk to face Harry, Ron, Hermione, and the still sobbing Leanne. \"Well?\" she said sharply. \"What happened?\" Haltingly, and with many pauses while she attempted to control her crying, Leanne told Professor McGonagall how Katie had gone to the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks and returned holding the unmarked package, how Katie had seemed a little odd, and  how they had argued about the advisability of agreeing to deliver unknown objects, the argument culminating in the tussle over the parcel, which tore open. At this point, Leanne was so overcome, there was no getting another word out of her. \"All right,\" said Professor McGonagall, not unkindly, \"go up to the hospital wing, please, Leanne, and get Madam Pomfrey to give you something for shock.\" When she had left the room, Professor McGonagall turned back to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"What happened when Katie touched the necklace?\" \"She rose up in the air,\" said Harry, before either Ron or Hermione could speak, \"and then began to scream, and collapsed. Professor, can I see Professor Dumbledore, please?\" \"The headmaster is away until Monday, Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall, looking surprised. \"Away?\" Harry repeated angrily. \"Yes, Potter, away!\" said Professor McGonagall tartly. \"But anything you have to say about this horrible business can be said to me, I'm sure!\" For a split second, Harry hesitated. Professor McGonagall did not invite confidences; Dumbledore, though in many ways more intimidating, still seemed less likely to scorn a theory, however wild. This was a life-and-death matter, though, and no moment to worry about being laughed at. \"I think Draco Malfoy gave Katie that necklace, Professor.\" On one side of him, Ron rubbed his nose in apparent embarrassment; on the other, Hermione shuffled her feet as though quite keen to put a bit of distance between herself and Harry. \"That is a very serious accusation, Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall, after a shocked pause. \"Do you have any proof?\" \"No,\" said Harry, \"but . . .\" and he told her about following Malfoy to Borgin and Burkes and the conversation they had overheard between him and Mr. Borgin. When he had finished speaking, Professor McGonagall looked slightly confused. \"Malfoy took something to Borgin and Burkes for repair?\" \"No, Professor, he just wanted Borgin to tell him how to mend something, he didn't have it with him. But that's not the point, the thing is that he bought something at the same time, and I think it was that necklace —\" \"You saw Malfoy leaving the shop with a similar package?\" \"No, Professor, he told Borgin to keep it in the shop for him —\" \"But Harry,\" Hermione interrupted, \"Borgin asked him if he wanted to take it with him, and Malfoy said no —\" \"Because he didn't want to touch it, obviously!\" said Harry angrily. \"What he actually said was, 'How would I look carrying that down the street?' \" said Hermione. \"Well, he would look a bit of a prat carrying a necklace,\" interjected Ron. \"Oh, Ron,\" said Hermione despairingly, \"it would be all wrapped up, so he wouldn't have to touch it, and quite easy to hide inside a cloak, so nobody would see it! I think whatever he reserved at Borgin and Burkes was noisy or bulky, something he knew would draw attention to him if he carried it down the street — and in any case,\" she pressed on loudly, before Harry could interrupt, \"I asked Borgin about the necklace, don't you remember? When I went in to try and find out what Malfoy had asked him to keep, I saw it there. And Borgin just told me the price, he didn't say it was already sold or anything —\" \"Well, you were being really obvious, he realized what you were up to within about five seconds, of course he wasn't going to tell you — anyway, Malfoy could've sent off for it since —\" \"That's enough!\" said Professor McGonagall, as Hermione opened her mouth to retort, looking furious. \"Potter, I appreciate you telling me this, but we cannot point the finger of blame at Mr. Malfoy purely because he visited the shop where this necklace might have been purchased. The same is probably true of hundreds of people —\" \"— that's what I said —\" muttered Ron. \"— and in any case, we have put stringent security measures in place this year. I do not believe that necklace can possibly have entered this school without our knowledge —\" \"But —\" \"— and what is more,\" said Professor McGonagall, with an air of awful finality, \"Mr. Malfoy was not in Hogsmeade today.\" Harry gaped at her, deflating. \"How do you know, Professor?\" \"Because he was doing detention with me. He has now failed to complete his Transfiguration homework twice in a row. So, thank you for telling me your suspicions, Potter,\" she said as she marched past them, \"but I need to go up to the hospital wing now to check on Katie Bell. Good day to you all.\" She held open her office door. They had no choice but to file past her without another word. Harry was angry with the other two for siding with McGonagall; nevertheless, he felt compelled to join in once they started discussing what had happened. \"So who do you reckon Katie was supposed to give the necklace to?\" asked Ron, as they climbed the stairs to the common room. \"Goodness only knows,\" said Hermione. \"But whoever it was has had a narrow escape. No one could have opened that package without touching the necklace.\" \"It could've been meant for loads of people,\" said Harry. \"Dumbledore — the Death Eaters would love to get rid of him, he must be one of their top targets. Or Slughorn — Dumbledore reckons Voldemort really wanted him and they can't be pleased that he's sided with Dumbledore. Or —\" \"Or you,\" said Hermione, looking troubled. \"Couldn't have been,\" said Harry, \"or Katie would've just turned around in the lane and given it to me, wouldn't she? I was behind her all the way out of the Three Broomsticks. It would have made much more sense to deliver the parcel outside Hogwarts, what with Filch searching everyone who goes in and out. I wonder why Malfoy told her to take it into the castle?\" \"Harry, Malfoy wasn't in Hogsmeade!\" said Hermione, actually stamping her foot in frustration. \"He must have used an accomplice, then,\" said Harry. \"Crabbe or Goyle — or, come to think of it, another Death Eater, he'll have loads better cronies than Crabbe and Goyle now he's joined up —\" Ron and Hermione exchanged looks that plainly said There's no point arguing with him. \"Dilligrout,\" said Hermione firmly as they reached the Fat Lady. The portrait swung open to admit them to the common room. It was quite full and smelled of damp clothing; many people seemed to have returned from Hogsmeade early because of the bad weather. There was no buzz of fear or speculation, however: Clearly, the news of Katie's fate had not yet spread. \"It wasn't a very slick attack, really, when you stop and think about it,\" said Ron, casually turfing a first year out of one of the good armchairs by the fire so that he could sit down. \"The curse didn't even make it into the castle. Not what you'd call foolproof.\" \"You're right,\" said Hermione, prodding Ron out of the chair with her foot and offering it to the first year again. \"It wasn't very well thought-out at all.\" \"But since when has Malfoy been one of the world's great thinkers?\" asked Harry. Neither Ron nor Hermione answered him.\n",

      "They had expected to have to comb Hermione's Daily Prophet carefully next morning to find the article Percy had mentioned in his letter. However, the departing delivery owl had barely cleared the top of the milk jug when Hermione let out a huge gasp and flattened the newspaper to reveal a large photograph of Dolores Um-bridge, smiling widely and blinking slowly at them from beneath the headline: MINISTRY SEEKS EDUCATIONAL REFORM DOLORES UMBRIDGE APPOINTED FIRST-EVER \"HIGH INQUISITOR\" \" 'High Inquisitor'?\" said Harry darkly, his half-eaten bit of toast slipping from his fingers. \"What does that mean?\" Hermione read aloud: \"In a surprise move last night the Ministry of Magic passed new legislation giving itself an unprecedented level of control at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. \"'The Minister has been growing uneasy about goings-on at Hogwarts for some time,' said Junior Assistant to the Minister, Percy Weasley. 'He is now responding to concerns voiced by anxious parents, who feel the school may be moving in a direction they do not approve.' \"This is not the first time in recent weeks Fudge has used new laws to effect improvements at the Wizarding school. As recently as August 30th Educational Decree Twenty-two was passed, to ensure that, in the event of the current headmaster being unable to provide a candidate for a teaching post, the Ministry should select an appropriate person. \"'That's how Dolores Umbridge came to be appointed to the teaching staff at Hogwarts,' said Weasley last night. 'Dumbledore couldn't find anyone, so the Minister put in Umbridge and of course, she's been an immediate success —' \" \"She's been a WHAT?\" said Harry loudly. \"Wait, there's more,\" said Hermione grimly. \" '— an immediate success, totally revolutionizing the teaching of Defense Against the Dark Arts and providing the Minister with on-theground feedback about what's really happening at Hogwarts.' \"It is this last function that the Ministry has now formalized with the passing of Educational Decree Twenty-three, which creates the new position of 'Hogwarts High Inquisitor.' \"'This is an exciting new phase in the Minister's plan to get to grips with what some are calling the \"falling standards\" at Hogwarts,' said Weasley. 'The Inquisitor will have powers to inspect her fellow educators and make sure that they are coming up to scratch. Professor Umbridge has been offered this position in addition to her own teaching post, and we are delighted to say that she has accepted.' \"The Ministry's new moves have received enthusiastic support from parents of students at Hogwarts. \"'I feel much easier in my mind now that I know that Dumbledore is being subjected to fair and objective evaluation,' said Mr. Lucius Malfoy, 41, speaking from his Wiltshire mansion last night. 'Many of us with our children's best interests at heart have been concerned about some of Dumbledore's eccentric decisions in the last few years and will be glad to know that the Ministry is keeping an eye on the situation.' \"Among those 'eccentric decisions' are undoubtedly the controversial staff appointments previously described in this newspaper, which have included the hiring of werewolf Remus Lupin, half giant Rubeus Hagrid, and delusional ex-Auror 'Mad-Eye' Moody. \"Rumors abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious school of Hogwarts. \"'I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step toward ensuring that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose confidence,' said a Ministry insider last night. \"Wizengamot elders Griselda Marchbanks and Tiberius Ogden have resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of Inquisitor to Hogwarts. \"'Hogwarts is a school, not an outpost of Cornelius Fudge's office,' said Madam Marchbanks. 'This is a further disgusting attempt to discredit Al-bus Dumbledore.' (For a full account of Madam Marchbanks' alleged links to subversive goblin groups, turn to page 17).\" Hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other two. \"So now we know how we ended up with Umbridge! Fudge passed this 'Educational Decree' and forced her on us! And now he's given her the power to inspect other teachers!\" Hermione was breathing fast and her eyes were very bright. \"I can't believe this. It's outrageous. . . .\" \"I know it is,\" said Harry. He looked down at his right hand, clenched upon the tabletop, and saw the faint white outline of the words Umbridge had forced him to cut into his skin. But a grin was unfurling on Ron's face. \"What?\" said Harry and Hermione together, staring at him. \"Oh, I can't wait to see McGonagall inspected,\" said Ron happily. \"Umbridge won't know what's hit her.\" \"Well, come on,\" said Hermione, jumping up, \"we'd better get going, if she's inspecting Binns's class we don't want to be late. . . .\" But Professor Umbridge was not inspecting their History of Magic lesson, which was just as dull as the previous Monday, nor was she in Snape's dungeon when they arrived for double Potions, where Harry's moonstone essay was handed back to him with a large, spiky black D scrawled in an upper corner. \"I have awarded you the grades you would have received if you presented this work in your O.W.L,\" said Snape with a smirk, as he swept among them, passing back their homework. \"This should give you a realistic idea of what to expect in your examination.\" Snape reached the front of the class and turned to face them. \"The general standard of this homework was abysmal. Most of you would have failed had this been your examination. I expect to see a great deal more effort for this week's essay on the various varieties of venom antidotes, or I shall have to start handing out detentions to those dunces who get D's.\" He smirked as Malfoy sniggered and said in a carrying whisper, \"Some people got D's? Ha!\" Harry realized that Hermione was looking sideways to see what grade he had received; he slid his moonstone essay back into his bag as quickly as possible, feeling that he would rather keep that information private. Determined not to give Snape an excuse to fail him this lesson, Harry read and reread every line of the instructions on the blackboard at least three times before acting on them. His Strengthening Solution was not precisely the clear turquoise shade of Hermione's but it was at least blue rather than pink, like Neville's, and he delivered a flask of it to Snape's desk at the end of the lesson with a feeling of mingled defiance and relief. \"Well, that wasn't as bad as last week, was it?\" said Hermione, as they climbed the steps out of the dungeon and made their way across the entrance hall toward lunch. \"And the homework didn't go too badly either, did it?\" When neither Ron nor Harry answered, she pressed on, \"I mean, all right, I didn't expect the top grade, not if he's marking to O.W.L. standard, but a pass is quite encouraging at this stage, wouldn't you say?\" Harry made a noncommittal noise in his throat. \"Of course, a lot can happen between now and the exam, we've got plenty of time to improve, but the grades we're getting now are a sort of baseline, aren't they? Something we can build on . . .\" They sat down together at the Gryffindor table. \"Obviously, I'd have been thrilled if I'd gotten an O —\" \"Hermione,\" said Ron sharply, \"if you want to know what grades we got, ask.\" \"I don't — I didn't mean — well, if you want to tell me —\" \"I got a P,\" said Ron, ladling soup into his bowl. \"Happy?\" \"Well, that's nothing to be ashamed of,\" said Fred, who had just arrived at the table with George and Lee Jordan and was sitting down on Harry's right. \"Nothing wrong with a good healthy P.\" \"But,\" said Hermione, \"doesn't P stand for . . .\" \" 'Poor,' yeah,\" said Lee Jordan. \"Still, better than D, isn't it? 'Dreadful'?\" Harry felt his face grow warm and faked a small coughing fit over his roll. When he emerged from this he was sorry to find that Hermione was still in full flow about O.W.L. grades. \"So top grade's O for 'Outstanding,' \" she was saying, \"and then there's A —\" \"No, E,\" George corrected her, \"E for 'Exceeds Expectations.' And I've always thought Fred and I should've got E in everything, because we exceeded expectations just by turning up for the exams.\" They all laughed except Hermione, who plowed on, \"So after E, it's A for 'Acceptable,' and that's the last pass grade, isn't it?\" \"Yep,\" said Fred, dunking an entire roll in his soup, transferring it to his mouth, and swallowing it whole. \"Then you get P for 'Poor' \" — Ron raised both his arms in mock celebration — \"and D for 'Dreadful.' \" \"And then T,\" George reminded him. \"T?\" asked Hermione, looking appalled. \"Even lower than a D? What on earth does that stand for?\" \" 'Troll,' \" said George promptly. Harry laughed again, though he was not sure whether or not George was joking. He imagined trying to conceal from Hermione that he had received T's in all his O.W.L.s and immediately resolved to work harder from now on. \"You lot had an inspected lesson yet?\" Fred asked them. \"No,\" said Hermione at once, \"have you?\" \"Just now, before lunch,\" said George. \"Charms.\" \"What was it like?\" Harry and Hermione asked together. Fred shrugged. \"Not that bad. Umbridge just lurked in the corner making notes on a clipboard. You know what Flitwick's like, he treated her like a guest, didn't seem to bother him at all. She didn't say much. Asked Alicia a couple of questions about what the classes are normally like, Alicia told her they were really good, that was it.\" \"I can't see old Flitwick getting marked down,\" said George, \"he usually gets everyone through their exams all right.\" \"Who've you got this afternoon?\" Fred asked Harry. \"Trelawney —\" \"A T if ever I saw one —\" \"— and Umbridge herself.\" \"Well, be a good boy and keep your temper with Umbridge today,\" said George. \"Angelina'll do her nut if you miss any more Quidditch practices.\" But Harry did not have to wait for Defense Against the Dark Arts to meet Professor Umbridge. He was pulling out his dream diary in a seat at the very back of the shadowy Divination room when Ron elbowed him in the ribs and, looking round, he saw Professor Umbridge emerging through the trapdoor in the floor. The class, which had been talking cheerily, fell silent at once. The abrupt fall in the noise level made Professor Trelawney, who had been wafting about handing out Dream Oracles, look round. \"Good afternoon, Professor Trelawney,\" said Professor Umbridge with her wide smile. \"You received my note, I trust? Giving the time and date of your inspection?\" Professor Trelawney nodded curtly and, looking very disgruntled, turned her back on Professor Umbridge and continued to give out books. Still smiling, Professor Umbridge grasped the back of the nearest armchair and pulled it to the front of the class so that it was a few inches behind Professor Trelawney's seat. She then sat down, took her clipboard from her flowery bag, and looked up expectantly, waiting for the class to begin. Professor Trelawney pulled her shawls tight about her with slightly trembling hands and surveyed the class through her hugely magnifying lenses. \"We shall be continuing our study of prophetic dreams today,\" she said in a brave attempt at her usual mystic tones, though her voice shook slightly. \"Divide into pairs, please, and interpret each other's latest nighttime visions with the aid of the Oracle.\" She made as though to sweep back to her seat, saw Professor Um-bridge sitting right beside it, and immediately veered left toward Parvati and Lavender, who were already deep in discussion about Parvati's most recent dream. Harry opened his copy of The Dream Oracle, watching Umbridge covertly. She was making notes on her clipboard now. After a few minutes she got to her feet and began to pace the room in Trelawney's wake, listening to her conversations with students and posing questions here and there. Harry bent his head hurriedly over his book. \"Think of a dream, quick,\" he told Ron, \"in case the old toad comes our way.\" \"I did it last time,\" Ron protested, \"it's your turn, you tell me one.\" \"Oh, I dunno . . .\" said Harry desperately, who could not remember dreaming anything at all over the last few days. \"Let's say I dreamed I was . . . drowning Snape in my cauldron. Yeah, that'll do. . . .\" Ron chortled as he opened his Dream Oracle. \"Okay, we've got to add your age to the date you had the dream, the number of letters in the subject . . . would that be 'drowning' or 'cauldron' or 'Snape'?\" \"It doesn't matter, pick any of them,\" said Harry, chancing a glance behind him. Professor Umbridge was now standing at Professor Trelawney's shoulder making notes while the Divination teacher questioned Neville about his dream diary. \"What night did you dream this again?\" Ron said, immersed in calculations. \"I dunno, last night, whenever you like,\" Harry told him, trying to listen to what Umbridge was saying to Professor Trelawney. They were only a table away from him and Ron now. Professor Umbridge was making another note on her clipboard and Professor Trelawney was looking extremely put out. \"Now,\" said Umbridge, looking up at Trelawney, \"you've been in this post how long, exactly?\" Professor Trelawney scowled at her, arms crossed and shoulders hunched as though wishing to protect herself as much as possible from the indignity of the inspection. After a slight pause in which she seemed to decide that the question was not so offensive that she could reasonably ignore it, she said in a deeply resentful tone, \"Nearly sixteen years.\" \"Quite a period,\" said Professor Umbridge, making a note on her clipboard. \"So it was Professor Dumbledore who appointed you?\" \"That's right,\" said Professor Trelawney shortly. Professor Umbridge made another note. \"And you are a great-great-granddaughter of the celebrated Seer Cassandra Trelawney?\" \"Yes,\" said Professor Trelawney, holding her head a little higher. Another note on the clipboard. \"But I think — correct me if I am mistaken — that you are the first in your family since Cassandra to be possessed of second sight?\" \"These things often skip — er — three generations,\" said Professor Trelawney. Professor Umbridge's toadlike smile widened. \"Of course,\" she said sweetly, making yet another note. \"Well, if you could just predict something for me, then?\" She looked up inquiringly, still smiling. Professor Trelawney had stiffened as though unable to believe her ears. \"I don't understand you,\" said Professor Trelawney, clutching convulsively at the shawl around her scrawny neck. \"I'd like you to make a prediction for me,\" said Professor Umbridge very clearly. Harry and Ron were not the only people watching and listening sneakily from behind their books now; most of the class were staring transfixed at Professor Trelawney as she drew herself up to her full height, her beads and bangles clinking. \"The Inner Eye does not See upon command!\" she said in scandalized tones. \"I see,\" said Professor Umbridge softly, making yet another note on her clipboard. \"I — but — but . . . wait!\" said Professor Trelawney suddenly, in an attempt at her usual ethereal voice, though the mystical effect was ruined somewhat by the way it was shaking with anger. \"I . . . I think I do see something . . . something that concerns you. . . . Why, I sense something . . . something dark . . . some grave peril . . .\" Professor Trelawney pointed a shaking finger at Professor Um-bridge who continued to smile blandly at her, eyebrows raised. \"I am afraid . . . I am afraid that you are in grave danger!\" Professor Trelawney finished dramatically. There was a pause. Professor Umbridge's eyebrows were still raised. \"Right,\" she said softly, scribbling on her clipboard once more. \"Well, if that's really the best you can do . . .\" She turned away, leaving Professor Trelawney standing rooted to the spot, her chest heaving. Harry caught Ron's eye and knew that Ron was thinking exactly the same as he was: They both knew that Professor Trelawney was an old fraud, but on the other hand, they loathed Umbridge so much that they felt very much on Trelawney's side — until she swooped down on them a few seconds later, that was. \"Well?\" she said, snapping her long fingers under Harry's nose, uncharacteristically brisk. \"Let me see the start you've made on your dream diary, please.\" And by the time she had interpreted Harry's dreams at the top of her voice (all of which, even the ones that involved eating porridge, apparently foretold a gruesome and early death), he was feeling much less sympathetic toward her. All the while, Professor Umbridge stood a few feet away, making notes on that clipboard, and when the bell rang she descended the silver ladder first so that she was waiting for them all when they reached their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson ten minutes later. She was humming and smiling to herself when they entered the room. Harry and Ron told Hermione, who had been in Arithmancy, exactly what had happened in Divination while they all took out their copies of Defensive Magical Theory, but before Hermione could ask any questions Professor Umbridge had called them all to order and silence fell. \"Wands away,\" she instructed them all smilingly, and those people who had been hopeful enough to take them out sadly returned them to their bags. \"As we finished chapter one last lesson, I would like you all to turn to page nineteen today and commence chapter two, 'Common Defensive Theories and Their Derivation.' There will be no need to talk.\" Still smiling her wide, self-satisfied smile, she sat down at her desk. The class gave an audible sigh as it turned, as one, to page nineteen. Harry wondered dully whether there were enough chapters in the book to keep them reading through all this year's lessons and was on the point of checking the contents when he noticed that Hermione had her hand in the air again. Professor Umbridge had noticed too, and what was more, she seemed to have worked out a strategy for just such an eventuality. Instead of trying to pretend she had not noticed Hermione, she got to her feet and walked around the front row of desks until they were face-to-face, then she bent down and whispered, so that the rest of the class could not hear, \"What is it this time, Miss Granger?\" \"I've already read chapter two,\" said Hermione. \"Well then, proceed to chapter three.\" \"I've read that too. I've read the whole book.\" Professor Umbridge blinked but recovered her poise almost instantly. \"Well, then, you should be able to tell me what Slinkhard says about counterjinxes in chapter fifteen.\" \"He says that counterjinxes are improperly named,\" said Hermione promptly. \"He says 'counterjinx' is just a name people give their jinxes when they want to make them sound more acceptable.\" Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows, and Harry knew she was impressed against her will. \"But I disagree,\" Hermione continued. Professor Umbridge's eyebrows rose a little higher and her gaze became distinctly colder. \"You disagree?\" \"Yes, I do,\" said Hermione, who, unlike Umbridge, was not whispering, but speaking in a clear, carrying voice that had by now attracted the rest of the class's attention. \"Mr. Slinkhard doesn't like jinxes, does he? But I think they can be very useful when they're used defensively.\" \"Oh, you do, do you?\" said Professor Umbridge, forgetting to whisper and straightening up. \"Well, I'm afraid it is Mr. Slinkhard's opinion, and not yours, that matters within this classroom, Miss Granger.\" \"But —\" Hermione began. \"That is enough,\" said Professor Umbridge. She walked back to the front of the class and stood before them, all the jauntiness she had shown at the beginning of the lesson gone. \"Miss Granger, I am going to take five points from Gryffindor House.\" There was an outbreak of muttering at this. \"What for?\" said Harry angrily. \"Don't you get involved!\" Hermione whispered urgently to him. \"For disrupting my class with pointless interruptions,\" said Professor Umbridge smoothly. \"I am here to teach you using a Ministry-approved method that does not include inviting students to give their opinions on matters about which they understand very little. Your previous teachers in this subject may have allowed you more license, but as none of them — with the possible exception of Professor Quirrell, who did at least appear to have restricted himself to age-appropriate subjects — would have passed a Ministry inspection —\" \"Yeah, Quirrell was a great teacher,\" said Harry loudly, \"there was just that minor drawback of him having Lord Voldemort sticking out of the back of his head.\" This pronouncement was followed by one of the loudest silences Harry had ever heard. Then — \"I think another week's detentions would do you some good, Mr. Potter,\" said Umbridge sleekly. The cut on the back of Harry's hand had barely healed and by the following morning, it was bleeding again. He did not complain during the evening's detention; he was determined not to give Umbridge the satisfaction; over and over again he wrote I must not tell lies and not a sound escaped his lips, though the cut deepened with every letter. The very worst part of this second week's worth of detentions was, just as George had predicted, Angelina's reaction. She cornered him just as he arrived at the Gryffindor table for breakfast on Tuesday and shouted so loudly that Professor McGonagall came sweeping down upon the pair of them from the staff table. \"Miss Johnson, how dare you make such a racket in the Great Hall! Five points from Gryffindor!\" \"But Professor — he's gone and landed himself in detention again —\" \"What's this, Potter?\" said Professor McGonagall sharply, rounding on Harry. \"Detention? From whom?\" \"From Professor Umbridge,\" muttered Harry, not meeting Professor McGonagall's beady, square-framed eyes. \"Are you telling me,\" she said, lowering her voice so that the group of curious Ravenclaws behind them could not hear, \"that after the warning I gave you last Monday you lost your temper in Professor Umbridge's class again?\" \"Yes,\" Harry muttered, speaking to the floor. \"Potter, you must get a grip on yourself! You are heading for serious trouble! Another five points from Gryffindor!\" \"But — what? Professor, no!\" Harry said, furious at this injustice. \"I'm already being punished by her, why do you have to take points as well?\" \"Because detentions do not appear to have any effect on you what- soever!\" said Professor McGonagall tartly. \"No, not another word of complaint, Potter! And as for you, Miss Johnson, you will confine your shouting matches to the Quidditch pitch in future or risk losing the team Captaincy!\" She strode back toward the staff table. Angelina gave Harry a look of deepest disgust and stalked away, upon which Harry flung himself onto the bench beside Ron, fuming. \"She's taken points off Gryffindor because I'm having my hand sliced open every night! How is that fair, how?\" \"I know, mate,\" said Ron sympathetically, tipping bacon onto Harry's plate, \"she's bang out of order.\" Hermione, however, merely rustled the pages of her Daily Prophet and said nothing. \"You think McGonagall was right, do you?\" said Harry angrily to the picture of Cornelius Fudge obscuring Hermione's face. \"I wish she hadn't taken points from you, but I think she's right to warn you not to lose your temper with Umbridge,\" said Hermione's voice, while Fudge gesticulated forcefully from the front page, clearly giving some kind of speech. Harry did not speak to Hermione all through Charms, but when they entered Transfiguration he forgot his anger; Professor Umbridge and her clipboard were sitting in a corner and the sight of her drove the memory of breakfast right out of his head. \"Excellent,\" whispered Ron, as they sat down in their usual seats. \"Let's see Umbridge get what she deserves.\" Professor McGonagall marched into the room without giving the slightest indication that she knew Professor Umbridge was there. \"That will do,\" she said and silence fell immediately. \"Mr. Finnigan, kindly come here and hand back the homework — Miss Brown, please take this box of mice — don't be silly, girl, they won't hurt you — and hand one to each student —\" \"Hem, hem,\" said Professor Umbridge, employing the same silly little cough she had used to interrupt Dumbledore on the first night of term. Professor McGonagall ignored her. Seamus handed back Harry's essay; Harry took it without looking at him and saw, to his relief, that he had managed an A. \"Right then, everyone, listen closely — Dean Thomas, if you do that to the mouse again I shall put you in detention — most of you have now successfully vanished your snails and even those who were left with a certain amount of shell have the gist of the spell. Today we shall be —\" \"Hem, hem,\" said Professor Umbridge. \"Yes?\" said Professor McGonagall, turning round, her eyebrows so close together they seemed to form one long, severe line. \"I was just wondering, Professor, whether you received my note telling you of the date and time of your inspec —\" \"Obviously I received it, or I would have asked you what you are doing in my classroom,\" said Professor McGonagall, turning her back firmly on Professor Umbridge. Many of the students exchanged looks of glee. \"As I was saying, today we shall be practicing the altogether more difficult vanishment of mice. Now, the Vanishing Spell —\" \"Hem, hem.\" \"I wonder,\" said Professor McGonagall in cold fury, turning on Professor Umbridge, \"how you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me? You see, I do not generally permit people to talk when I am talking.\" Professor Umbridge looked as though she had just been slapped in the face. She did not speak, but straightened the parchment on her clipboard and began scribbling furiously. Looking supremely unconcerned, Professor McGonagall addressed the class once more. \"As I was saying, the Vanishing Spell becomes more difficult with the complexity of the animal to be vanished. The snail, as an invertebrate, does not present much of a challenge; the mouse, as a mammal, offers a much greater one. This is not, therefore, magic you can accomplish with your mind on your dinner. So — you know the incantation, let me see what you can do. . . .\" \"How she can lecture me about not losing my temper with Umbridge!\" Harry said to Ron under his voice, but he was grinning; his anger with Professor McGonagall had quite evaporated. Professor Umbridge did not follow Professor McGonagall around the class as she had followed Professor Trelawney; perhaps she thought that Professor McGonagall would not permit it. She did, however, take many more notes while she sat in her corner, and when Professor McGonagall finally told them all to pack away, rose with a grim expression on her face. \"Well, it's a start,\" said Ron, holding up a long, wriggling mouse tail and dropping it back into the box Lavender was passing around. As they filed out of the classroom, Harry saw Professor Umbridge approach the teacher's desk; he nudged Ron, who nudged Hermione in turn, and the three of them deliberately fell back to eavesdrop. \"How long have you been teaching at Hogwarts?\" Professor Um-bridge asked. \"Thirty-nine years this December,\" said Professor McGonagall brusquely, snapping her bag shut. Professor Umbridge made a note. \"Very well,\" she said, \"you will receive the results of your inspection in ten days' time.\" \"I can hardly wait,\" said Professor McGonagall in a coldly indifferent voice, and she strode off toward the door. \"Hurry up, you three,\" she added, sweeping Harry, Ron, and Hermione before her. Harry could not help giving her a faint smile and could have sworn he received one in return. He had thought that the next time he would see Umbridge would be in his detention that evening, but he was wrong. When they walked down the lawns toward the forest for Care of Magical Creatures, they found her and her clipboard waiting for them beside Professor Grubbly-Plank. \"You do not usually take this class, is that correct?\" Harry heard her ask as they arrived at the trestle table where the group of captive bowtruckles were scrabbling around for wood lice like so many living twigs. \"Quite correct,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank, hands behind her back and bouncing on the balls of her feet. \"I am a substitute teacher standing in for Professor Hagrid.\" Harry exchanged uneasy looks with Ron and Hermione. Malfoy was whispering with Crabbe and Goyle; he would surely love this opportunity to tell tales on Hagrid to a member of the Ministry. \"Hmm,\" said Professor Umbridge, dropping her voice, though Harry could still hear her quite clearly, \"I wonder — the headmaster seems strangely reluctant to give me any information on the matter — can you tell me what is causing Professor Hagrid's very extended leave of absence?\" Harry saw Malfoy look up eagerly. \" 'Fraid I can't,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank breezily. \"Don't know anything more about it than you do. Got an owl from Dumbledore, would I like a couple of weeks teaching work, accepted — that's as much as I know. Well . . . shall I get started then?\" \"Yes, please do,\" said Professor Umbridge, scribbling upon her clipboard. Umbridge took a different tack in this class and wandered among the students, questioning them on magical creatures. Most people were able to answer well and Harry's spirits lifted somewhat; at least the class was not letting Hagrid down. \"Overall,\" said Professor Umbridge, returning to Professor GrubblyPlank's side after a lengthy interrogation of Dean Thomas, \"how do you, as a temporary member of staff — an objective outsider, I suppose  you might say — how do you find Hogwarts? Do you feel you receive enough support from the school management?\" \"Oh, yes, Dumbledore's excellent,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank heartily. \"No, I'm very happy with the way things are run, very happy indeed.\" Looking politely incredulous, Umbridge made a tiny note on her clipboard and went on, \"And what are you planning to cover with this class this year — assuming, of course, that Professor Hagrid does not return?\" \"Oh, I'll take them through the creatures that most often come up in O.W.L.,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank. \"Not much left to do — they've studied unicorns and nifflers, I thought we'd cover porlocks and kneazles, make sure they can recognize crups and knarls, you know. . . .\" \"Well, you seem to know what you're doing, at any rate,\" said Professor Umbridge, making a very obvious tick on her clipboard. Harry did not like the emphasis she put on \"you\" and liked it even less when she put her next question to Goyle: \"Now, I hear there have been injuries in this class?\" Goyle gave a stupid grin. Malfoy hastened to answer the question. \"That was me,\" he said. \"I was slashed by a hippogriff.\" \"A hippogriff?\" said Professor Umbridge, now scribbling frantically. \"Only because he was too stupid to listen to what Hagrid told him to do,\" said Harry angrily. Both Ron and Hermione groaned. Professor Umbridge turned her head slowly in Harry's direction. \"Another night's detention, I think,\" she said softly. \"Well, thank you very much, Professor Grubbly-Plank, I think that's all I need here. You will be receiving the results of your inspection within ten days.\" \"Jolly good,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and Professor Um-bridge set off back across the lawn to the castle. It was nearly midnight when Harry left Umbridge's office that night, his hand now bleeding so severely that it was staining the scarf he had wrapped around it. He expected the common room to be empty when he returned, but Ron and Hermione had sat up waiting for him. He was pleased to see them, especially as Hermione was disposed to be sympathetic rather than critical. \"Here,\" she said anxiously, pushing a small bowl of yellow liquid toward him, \"soak your hand in that, it's a solution of strained and pickled murtlap tentacles, it should help.\" Harry placed his bleeding, aching hand into the bowl and experienced a wonderful feeling of relief. Crookshanks curled around his legs, purring loudly, and then leapt into his lap and settled down. \"Thanks,\" he said gratefully, scratching behind Crookshanks's ears with his left hand. \"I still reckon you should complain about this,\" said Ron in a low voice. \"No,\" said Harry flatly. \"McGonagall would go nuts if she knew —\" \"Yeah, she probably would,\" said Harry. \"And how long d'you reckon it'd take Umbridge to pass another Decree saying anyone who complains about the High Inquisitor gets sacked immediately?\" Ron opened his mouth to retort but nothing came out and after a moment he closed it again in a defeated sort of way. \"She's an awful woman,\" said Hermione in a small voice. \"Awful. You know, I was just saying to Ron when you came in . . . we've got to do something about her.\" \"I suggested poison,\" said Ron grimly. \"No . . . I mean, something about what a dreadful teacher she is, and how we're not going to learn any defense from her at all,\" said Hermione. \"Well, what can we do about that?\" said Ron, yawning. \" 'S too late, isn't it? She got the job, she's here to stay, Fudge'll make sure of that.\" \"Well,\" said Hermione tentatively. \"You know, I was thinking today. . . .\" She shot a slightly nervous look at Harry and then plunged on, \"I was thinking that — maybe the time's come when we should just — just do it ourselves.\" \"Do what ourselves?\" said Harry suspiciously, still floating his hand in the essence of murtlap tentacles. \"Well — learn Defense Against the Dark Arts ourselves,\" said Hermione. \"Come off it,\" groaned Ron. \"You want us to do extra work? D'you realize Harry and I are behind on homework again and it's only the second week?\" \"But this is much more important than homework!\" said Hermione. Harry and Ron goggled at her. \"I didn't think there was anything in the universe more important than homework,\" said Ron. \"Don't be silly, of course there is!\" said Hermione, and Harry saw, with an ominous feeling, that her face was suddenly alight with the kind of fervor that S.P.E.W. usually inspired in her. \"It's about preparing ourselves, like Harry said in Umbridge's first lesson, for what's waiting out there. It's about making sure we really can defend ourselves. If we don't learn anything for a whole year —\" \"We can't do much by ourselves,\" said Ron in a defeated voice. \"I mean, all right, we can go and look jinxes up in the library and try and practice them, I suppose —\" \"No, I agree, we've gone past the stage where we can just learn things out of books,\" said Hermione. \"We need a teacher, a proper one, who can show us how to use the spells and correct us if we're going wrong.\" \"If you're talking about Lupin . . .\" Harry began. \"No, no, I'm not talking about Lupin,\" said Hermione. \"He's too busy with the Order and anyway, the most we could see him is during Hogsmeade weekends and that's not nearly often enough.\" \"Who, then?\" said Harry, frowning at her. Hermione heaved a very deep sigh. \"Isn't it obvious?\" she said. \"I'm talking about you, Harry.\" There was a moment's silence. A light night breeze rattled the windowpanes behind Ron and the fire guttered. \"About me what?\" said Harry. \"I'm talking about you teaching us Defense Against the Dark Arts.\" Harry stared at her. Then he turned to Ron, ready to exchange the exasperated looks they sometimes shared when Hermione elaborated on far-fetched schemes like S.P.E.W. To Harry's consternation, however, Ron did not look exasperated. He was frowning slightly, apparently thinking. Then he said, \"That's an idea.\" \"What's an idea?\" said Harry. \"You,\" said Ron. \"Teaching us to do it.\" \"But . . .\" Harry was grinning now, sure the pair of them were pulling his leg. \"But I'm not a teacher, I can't —\" \"Harry, you're the best in the year at Defense Against the Dark Arts,\" said Hermione. \"Me?\" said Harry, now grinning more broadly than ever. \"No I'm not, you've beaten me in every test —\" \"Actually, I haven't,\" said Hermione coolly. \"You beat me in our third year — the only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who actually knew the subject. But I'm not talking about test results, Harry. Look what you've done!\" \"How d'you mean?\" \"You know what, I'm not sure I want someone this stupid teaching me,\" Ron said to Hermione, smirking slightly. He turned to Harry. \"Let's think,\" he said, pulling a face like Goyle concentrating. \"Uh . . . first year — you saved the Stone from You-Know-Who.\" \"But that was luck,\" said Harry, \"that wasn't skill —\" \"Second year,\" Ron interrupted, \"you killed the basilisk and destroyed Riddle.\" \"Yeah, but if Fawkes hadn't turned up I —\" \"Third year,\" said Ron, louder still, \"you fought off about a hundred dementors at once —\" \"You know that was a fluke, if the Time-Turner hadn't —\" \"Last year,\" Ron said, almost shouting now, \"you fought off YouKnow-Who again —\" \"Listen to me!\" said Harry, almost angrily, because Ron and Hermione were both smirking now. \"Just listen to me, all right? It sounds great when you say it like that, but all that stuff was luck — I didn't know what I was doing half the time, I didn't plan any of it, I just did whatever I could think of, and I nearly always had help —\" Ron and Hermione were still smirking and Harry felt his temper rise; he wasn't even sure why he was feeling so angry. \"Don't sit there grinning like you know better than I do, I was there, wasn't I?\" he said heatedly. \"I know what went on, all right? And I didn't get through any of that because I was brilliant at Defense Against the Dark Arts, I got through it all because — because help came at the right time, or because I guessed right — but I just blundered through it all, I didn't have a clue what I was doing — STOP LAUGHING!\" The bowl of murtlap essence fell to the floor and smashed. He became aware that he was on his feet, though he couldn't remember standing up. Crookshanks streaked away under a sofa; Ron and Hermione's smiles had vanished. \"You don't know what it's like! You — neither of you — you've never had to face him, have you? You think it's just memorizing a bunch of spells and throwing them at him, like you're in class or something? The whole time you know there's nothing between you and dying except your own — your own brain or guts or whatever — like you can think straight when you know you're about a second from being murdered, or tortured, or watching your friends die — they've never taught us that in their classes, what it's like to deal with things like that — and you two sit there acting like I'm a clever little boy to be standing here, alive, like Diggory was stupid, like he messed up — you just don't get it, that could just as easily have been me, it would have been if Voldemort hadn't needed me —\" \"We weren't saying anything like that, mate,\" said Ron, looking aghast. \"We weren't having a go at Diggory, we didn't — you've got the wrong end of the —\" He looked helplessly at Hermione, whose face was stricken. \"Harry,\" she said timidly, \"don't you see? This . . . this is exactly why we need you. . . . We need to know what it's r-really like . . . facing him . . . facing V-Voldemort.\" It was the first time she had ever said Voldemort's name, and it was this, more than anything else, that calmed Harry. Still breathing hard, he sank back into his chair, becoming aware as he did so that his hand was throbbing horribly again. He wished he had not smashed the bowl of murtlap essence. \"Well . . . think about it,\" said Hermione quietly. \"Please?\" Harry could not think of anything to say. He was feeling ashamed of his outburst already. He nodded, hardly aware of what he was agreeing to. Hermione stood up. \"Well, I'm off to bed,\" she said in a voice that was clearly as natural as she could make it. \"Erm . . . 'night.\" Ron had gotten to his feet too. \"Coming?\" he said awkwardly to Harry. \"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"In . . . in a minute. I'll just clear this up.\" He indicated the smashed bowl on the floor. Ron nodded and left. \"Reparo,\" Harry muttered, pointing his wand at the broken pieces of china. They flew back together, good as new, but there was no returning the murtlap essence to the bowl. He was suddenly so tired that he was tempted to sink back into his armchair and sleep there, but instead he got to his feet and followed Ron upstairs. His restless night was punctuated once more by dreams of long corridors and locked doors, and he awoke next day with his scar prickling again.\n",

      "BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. \"Where's the cannon?\" he said stupidly. There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands — now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them. \"Who's there?\" he shouted. \"I warn you — I'm armed!\" There was a pause. Then — SMASH! The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor. A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair. The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all. \"Couldn't make us a cup o' tea, could yeh? It's not been an easy journey. . . .\" He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear. \"Budge up, yeh great lump,\" said the stranger. Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon. \"An' here's Harry!\" said the giant. Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile. \"Las' time I saw you, you was only a baby,\" said the giant. \"Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh've got yer mom's eyes.\" Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise. \"I demand that you leave at once, sir!\" he said. \"You are breaking and entering!\" \"Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\" said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon's hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room. Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on. \"Anyway — Harry,\" said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, \"a very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here — I mighta sat on it at some point, but it'll taste all right.\" From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly  squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing. Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, \"Who are you?\" The giant chuckled. \"True, I haven't introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.\" He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry's whole arm. \"What about that tea then, eh?\" he said, rubbing his hands together. \"I'd not say no ter summat stronger if yeh've got it, mind.\" His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn't see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he'd sunk into a hot bath. The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, \"Don't touch anything he gives you, Dudley.\" The giant chuckled darkly. \"Yer great puddin' of a son don' need fattenin' anymore, Dursley, don' worry.\" He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn't take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, \"I'm sorry, but I still don't really know who you are.\" The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. \"Call me Hagrid,\" he said, \"everyone does. An' like I told yeh, I'm Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts — yeh'll know all about Hog-warts, o' course.\" \"Er — no,\" said Harry. Hagrid looked shocked. \"Sorry,\" Harry said quickly. \"Sorry?\" barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. \"It's them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren't gettin' yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn't even know abou' Hogwarts, fer cryin' out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all?\" \"All what?\" asked Harry. \"ALL WHAT?\" Hagrid thundered. \"Now wait jus' one second!\" He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall. \"Do you mean ter tell me,\" he growled at the Dursleys, \"that this boy — this boy! — knows nothin' abou' — about ANYTHING?\" Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren't bad. \"I know some things,\" he said. \"I can, you know, do math and stuff.\" But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, \"About our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents' world.\" \"What world?\" Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode. \"DURSLEY!\" he boomed. Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like \"Mimblewimble.\" Hagrid stared wildly at Harry. \"But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,\" he said. \"I mean, they're famous. You're famous.\" \"What? My — my mom and dad weren't famous, were they?\" \"Yeh don' know . . . yeh don' know . . .\" Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare. \"Yeh don' know what yeh are?\" he said finally. Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice. \"Stop!\" he commanded. \"Stop right there, sir! I forbid you to tell the boy anything!\" A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage. \"You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An' you've kept it from him all these years?\" \"Kept what from me?\" said Harry eagerly. \"STOP! I FORBID YOU!\" yelled Uncle Vernon in panic. Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror. \"Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,\" said Hagrid. \"Harry — yer a wizard.\" There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard. \"I'm a what?\" gasped Harry. \"A wizard, o' course,\" said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, \"an' a thumpin' good'un, I'd say, once yeh've been trained up a bit. With a mum an' dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An' I reckon it's abou' time yeh read yer letter.\" Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY Headmaster: Albus Dumbledore (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards ) Dear Mr. Potter, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31. Yours sincerely, Minerva McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress Questions exploded inside Harry's head like fireworks and he couldn't decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, \"What does it mean, they await my owl?\" \"Gallopin' Gorgons, that reminds me,\" said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl — a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry his letter. Taking him to buy his things tomorrow. Weather's horrible. Hope you're well. Hagrid Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone. Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly. \"Where was I?\" said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight. \"He's not going,\" he said. Hagrid grunted. \"I'd like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,\" he said. \"A what?\" said Harry, interested. \"A Muggle,\" said Hagrid, \"it's what we call nonmagic folk like them. An' it's your bad luck you grew up in a family o' the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.\" \"We swore when we took him in we'd put a stop to that rubbish,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"swore we'd stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!\" \"You knew?\" said Harry. \"You knew I'm a — a wizard?\" \"Knew!\" shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. \"Knew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that — that school — and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was — a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!\" She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years. \"Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as — as — abnormal — and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!\" Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, \"Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!\" \"CAR CRASH!\" roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. \"How could a car crash kill Lily an' James Potter? It's an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin' his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!\" \"But why? What happened?\" Harry asked urgently. The anger faded from Hagrid's face. He looked suddenly anxious. \"I never expected this,\" he said, in a low, worried voice. \"I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin' hold of yeh, how much yeh didn't know. Ah, Harry, I don' know if I'm the right person ter tell yeh — but someone's gotta — yeh can't go off ter Hogwarts not knowin'.\" He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys. \"Well, it's best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh — mind, I can't tell yeh everythin', it's a great myst'ry, parts of it. . . .\" He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, \"It begins, I suppose, with — with a person called — but it's incredible yeh don't know his name, everyone in our world knows —\" \"Who?\" \"Well — I don' like sayin' the name if I can help it. No one does.\" \"Why not?\" \"Gulpin' gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went . . . bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was . . .\" Hagrid gulped, but no words came out. \"Could you write it down?\" Harry suggested. \"Nah — can't spell it. All right — Voldemort.\" Hagrid shuddered. \"Don' make me say it again. Anyway, this — this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin' fer followers. Got 'em, too — some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o' his power, 'cause he was gettin' himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn't know who ter trust, didn't dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches . . . terrible things happened. He was takin' over. 'Course, some stood up to him — an' he killed 'em. Horribly. One o' the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn't dare try takin' the school, not jus' then, anyway. \"Now, yer mum an' dad were as good a witch an' wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an' girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the mys-t'ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get 'em on his side before . . . probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin' ter do with the Dark Side. \"Maybe he thought he could persuade 'em . . . maybe he just wanted 'em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an' — an' —\" Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"But it's that sad — knew yer mum an' dad, an' nicer people yeh couldn't find — anyway . . . \"You-Know-Who killed 'em. An' then — an' this is the real myst'ry of the thing — he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin' by then. But he couldn't do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That's what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took care of yer mum an' dad an' yer house, even — but it didn't work on you, an' that's why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill 'em, no one except you, an' he'd killed some o' the best witches an' wizards of the age — the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts — an' you was only a baby, an' you lived.\" Something very painful was going on in Harry's mind. As Hagrid's story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before — and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh. Hagrid was watching him sadly. \"Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore's orders. Brought yeh ter this lot . . .\" \"Load of old tosh,\" said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Ha-grid and his fists were clenched. \"Now, you listen here, boy,\" he snarled, \"I accept there's something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn't have cured — and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world's better off without them in my opinion — asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types — just what I expected, always knew they'd come to a sticky end —\" But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, \"I'm warning you, Dursley — I'm warning you — one more word . . .\" In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon's courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent. \"That's better,\" said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor. Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them. \"But what happened to Vol-, sorry — I mean, You-Know-Who?\" \"Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That's the biggest myst'ry, see . . . he was gettin' more an' more powerful — why'd he go? \"Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he's still out there, bidin' his time, like, but I don' believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of 'em came outta kinda trances. Don' reckon they could've done if he was comin' back. \"Most of us reckon he's still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. 'Cause somethin' about you finished him, Harry. There was somethin' goin' on that night he hadn't counted on — I dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin' about you stumped him, all right.\" Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He'd spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn't they been turned into warty toads every time they'd tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he'd once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football? \"Hagrid,\" he said quietly, \"I think you must have made a mistake. I don't think I can be a wizard.\" To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled. \"Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?\" Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it . . . every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry . . . chased by Dudley's gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach . . . dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he'd managed to make it grow back . . . and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn't he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn't he set a boa constrictor on him? Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him. \"See?\" said Hagrid. \"Harry Potter, not a wizard — you wait, you'll be right famous at Hogwarts.\" But Uncle Vernon wasn't going to give in without a fight. \"Haven't I told you he's not going?\" he hissed. \"He's going to Stonewall High and he'll be grateful for it. I've read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish — spell books and wands and —\" \"If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won't stop him,\" growled Hagrid. \"Stop Lily an' James Potter's son goin' ter Hog-warts! Yer mad. His name's been down ever since he was born. He's off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won't know himself. He'll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an' he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had, Albus Dumbled—\" \"I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!\" yelled Uncle Vernon. But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, \"NEVER —\" he thundered, \"— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE — IN — FRONT — OF — ME!\" He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig's tail poking through a hole in his trousers. Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them. Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard. \"Shouldn'ta lost me temper,\" he said ruefully, \"but it didn't work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn't much left ter do.\" He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows. \"Be grateful if yeh didn't mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,\" he said. \"I'm — er — not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin'. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an' get yer letters to yeh an' stuff — one o' the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job —\" \"Why aren't you supposed to do magic?\" asked Harry. \"Oh, well — I was at Hogwarts meself but I — er — got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an' everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.\" \"Why were you expelled?\" \"It's gettin' late and we've got lots ter do tomorrow,\" said Hagrid loudly. \"Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an' that.\" He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry. \"You can kip under that,\" he said. \"Don' mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o' dormice in one o' the pockets.\"\n",

      "He — he sent me this,\" Hermione said, holding out the letter. Harry took it. The parchment was damp, and enormous teardrops had smudged the ink so badly in places that it was very difficult to read. \"They can't do this,\" said Harry. \"They can't. Buckbeak isn't dangerous.\" \"Malfoy's dad's frightened the Committee into it,\" said Hermione, wiping her eyes. \"You know what he's like. They're a bunch of doddery old fools, and they were scared. There'll be an appeal, though, there always is. Only I can't see any hope. . . . Nothing will have changed.\" \"Yeah, it will,\" said Ron fiercely. \"You won't have to do all the work alone this time, Hermione. I'll help.\" \"Oh, Ron!\" Hermione flung her arms around Ron's neck and broke down completely. Ron, looking quite terrified, patted her very awkwardly on the top of the head. Finally, Hermione drew away. \"Ron, I'm really, really sorry about Scabbers . . . ,\" she sobbed. \"Oh — well — he was old,\" said Ron, looking thoroughly relieved that she had let go of him. \"And he was a bit useless. You never know, Mum and Dad might get me an owl now.\" The safety measures imposed on the students since Black's second break-in made it impossible for Harry, Ron, and Hermione to go and visit Hagrid in the evenings. Their only chance of talking to him was during Care of Magical Creatures lessons. He seemed numb with shock at the verdict. \"S'all my fault. Got all tongue-tied. They was all sittin' there in black robes an' I kep' droppin' me notes and forgettin' all them dates yeh looked up fer me, Hermione. An' then Lucius Malfoy stood up an' said his bit, and the Committee jus' did exac'ly what he told 'em. . . .\" \"There's still the appeal!\" said Ron fiercely. \"Don't give up yet, we're working on it!\" They were walking back up to the castle with the rest of the class. Ahead they could see Malfoy, who was walking with Crabbe and Goyle, and kept looking back, laughing derisively. \"S'no good, Ron,\" said Hagrid sadly as they reached the castle steps. \"That Committee's in Lucius Malfoy's pocket. I'm jus' gonna make sure the rest o' Beaky's time is the happiest he's ever had. I owe him that. . . .\" Hagrid turned around and hurried back toward his cabin, his face buried in his handkerchief. \"Look at him blubber!\" Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had been standing just inside the castle doors, listening. \"Have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic?\" said Malfoy. \"And he's supposed to be our teacher!\" Harry and Ron both made furious moves toward Malfoy, but Hermione got there first — SMACK! She had slapped Malfoy across the face with all the strength she could muster. Malfoy staggered. Harry, Ron, Crabbe, and Goyle stood flabbergasted as Hermione raised her hand again. \"Don't you dare call Hagrid pathetic, you foul — you evil —\" \"Hermione!\" said Ron weakly, and he tried to grab her hand as she swung it back. \"Get off, Ron!\" Hermione pulled out her wand. Malfoy stepped backward. Crabbe and Goyle looked at him for instructions, thoroughly bewildered. \"C'mon,\" Malfoy muttered, and in a moment, all three of them had disappeared into the passageway to the dungeons. \"Hermione!\" Ron said again, sounding both stunned and impressed. \"Harry, you'd better beat him in the Quidditch final!\" Hermione said shrilly. \"You just better had, because I can't stand it if Slytherin wins!\" \"We're due in Charms,\" said Ron, still goggling at Hermione. \"We'd better go.\" They hurried up the marble staircase toward Professor Flitwick's classroom. \"You're late, boys!\" said Professor Flitwick reprovingly as Harry opened the classroom door. \"Come along, quickly, wands out, we're experimenting with Cheering Charms today, we've already divided into pairs —\" Harry and Ron hurried to a desk at the back and opened their bags. Ron looked behind him. \"Where's Hermione gone?\" Harry looked around too. Hermione hadn't entered the classroom, yet Harry knew she had been right next to him when he had opened the door. \"That's weird,\" said Harry, staring at Ron. \"Maybe — maybe she went to the bathroom or something?\" But Hermione didn't turn up all lesson. \"She could've done with a Cheering Charm on her too,\" said Ron as the class left for lunch, all grinning broadly — the Cheering Charms had left them with a feeling of great contentment. Hermione wasn't at lunch either. By the time they had finished their apple pie, the after-effects of the Cheering Charms were wearing off, and Harry and Ron had started to get slightly worried. \"You don't think Malfoy did something to her?\" Ron said anxiously as they hurried upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower. They passed the security trolls, gave the Fat Lady the password (\"Flibbertigibbet\"), and scrambled through the portrait hole into the common room. Hermione was sitting at a table, fast asleep, her head resting on an open Arithmancy book. They went to sit down on either side of her. Harry prodded her awake. \"Wh — what?\" said Hermione, waking with a start and staring wildly around. \"Is it time to go? W — which lesson have we got now? \"Divination, but it's not for another twenty minutes,\" said Harry. \"Hermione, why didn't you come to Charms?\" \"What? Oh no!\" Hermione squeaked. \"I forgot to go to Charms!\" \"But how could you forget?\" said Harry. \"You were with us till we were right outside the classroom!\" \"I don't believe it!\" Hermione wailed. \"Was Professor Flitwick angry? Oh, it was Malfoy, I was thinking about him and I lost track of things!\" \"You know what, Hermione?\" said Ron, looking down at the enormous Arithmancy book Hermione had been using as a pillow. \"I reckon you're cracking up. You're trying to do too much.\" \"No, I'm not!\" said Hermione, brushing her hair out of her eyes and staring hopelessly around for her bag. \"I just made a mistake, that's all! I'd better go and see Professor Flitwick and say sorry. . . . I'll see you in Divination!\" Hermione joined them at the foot of the ladder to Professor  Trelawney's classroom twenty minutes later, looking extremely harassed. \"I can't believe I missed Cheering Charms! And I bet they come up in our exams; Professor Flitwick hinted they might!\" Together they climbed the ladder into the dim, stifling tower room. Glowing on every little table was a crystal ball full of pearly white mist. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down together at the same rickety table. \"I thought we weren't starting crystal balls until next term,\" Ron muttered, casting a wary eye around for Professor Trelawney, in case she was lurking nearby. \"Don't complain, this means we've finished palmistry,\" Harry muttered back. \"I was getting sick of her flinching every time she looked at my hands.\" \"Good day to you!\" said the familiar, misty voice, and Professor Trelawney made her usual dramatic entrance out of the shadows. Parvati and Lavender quivered with excitement, their faces lit by the milky glow of their crystal ball. \"I have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than I had planned,\" said Professor Trelawney, sitting with her back to the fire and gazing around. \"The fates have informed me that your examination in June will concern the Orb, and I am anxious to give you sufficient practice.\" Hermione snorted. \"Well, honestly . . . 'the fates have informed her' . . . who sets the exam? She does! What an amazing prediction!\" she said, not troubling to keep her voice low. Harry and Ron choked back laughs. It was hard to tell whether Professor Trelawney had heard them, as her face was hidden in shadow. She continued, however, as though she had not. \"Crystal gazing is a particularly refined art,\" she said dreamily. \"I do not expect any of you to See when first you peer into the Orb's infinite depths. We shall start by practicing relaxing the conscious mind and external eyes\" — Ron began to snigger uncontrollably and had to stuff his fist in his mouth to stifle the noise — \"so as to clear the Inner Eye and the superconscious. Perhaps, if we are lucky, some of you will See before the end of the class.\" And so they began. Harry, at least, felt extremely foolish, staring blankly at the crystal ball, trying to keep his mind empty when thoughts such as \"this is stupid\" kept drifting across it. It didn't help that Ron kept breaking into silent giggles and Hermione kept tutting. \"Seen anything yet?\" Harry asked them after a quarter of an hour's quiet crystal gazing. \"Yeah, there's a burn on this table,\" said Ron, pointing. \"Someone's spilled their candle.\" \"This is such a waste of time,\" Hermione hissed. \"I could be practicing something useful. I could be catching up on Cheering Charms —\" Professor Trelawney rustled past. \"Would anyone like me to help them interpret the shadowy portents within their Orb?\" she murmured over the clinking of her bangles. \"I don't need help,\" Ron whispered. \"It's obvious what this means. There's going to be loads of fog tonight.\" Both Harry and Hermione burst out laughing. \"Now, really!\" said Professor Trelawney as everyone's heads turned in their direction. Parvati and Lavender were looking scandalized. \"You are disturbing the clairvoyant vibrations!\" She approached their table and peered into their crystal ball. Harry felt his heart sinking. He was sure he knew what was coming — \"There is something here!\" Professor Trelawney whispered, lowering her face to the ball, so that it was reflected twice in her huge glasses. \"Something moving . . . but what is it?\" Harry was prepared to bet everything he owned, including his Firebolt, that it wasn't good news, whatever it was. And sure enough — \"My dear . . . ,\" Professor Trelawney breathed, gazing up at Harry. \"It is here, plainer than ever before . . . my dear, stalking toward you, growing ever closer . . . the Gr —\" \"Oh, for goodness' sake!\" said Hermione loudly. \"Not that ridiculous Grim again!\" Professor Trelawney raised her enormous eyes to Hermione's face. Parvati whispered something to Lavender, and they both glared at Hermione too. Professor Trelawney stood up, surveying Hermione with unmistakable anger. \"I am sorry to say that from the moment you have arrived in this class, my dear, it has been apparent that you do not have what the noble art of Divination requires. Indeed, I don't remember ever meeting a student whose mind was so hopelessly mundane.\" There was a moment's silence. Then — \"Fine!\" said Hermione suddenly, getting up and cramming Unfogging the Future back into her bag. \"Fine!\" she repeated, swinging the bag over her shoulder and almost knocking Ron off his chair. \"I give up! I'm leaving!\" And to the whole class's amazement, Hermione strode over to the trapdoor, kicked it open, and climbed down the ladder out of sight. It took a few minutes for the class to settle down again. Professor Trelawney seemed to have forgotten all about the Grim. She turned abruptly from Harry and Ron's table, breathing rather heavily as she tugged her gauzy shawl more closely to her. \"Ooooo!\" said Lavender suddenly, making everyone start. \"Oooooo, Professor Trelawney, I've just remembered! You saw her leaving, didn't you? Didn't you, Professor? 'Around Easter, one of our number will leave us forever!' You said it ages ago, Professor!\" Professor Trelawney gave her a dewy smile. \"Yes, my dear, I did indeed know that Miss Granger would be leaving us. One hopes, however, that one might have mistaken the Signs. . . . The Inner Eye can be a burden, you know. . . .\" Lavender and Parvati looked deeply impressed, and moved over so that Professor Trelawney could join their table instead. \"Some day Hermione's having, eh?\" Ron muttered to Harry, looking awed. \"Yeah . . .\" Harry glanced into the crystal ball but saw nothing but swirling white mist. Had Professor Trelawney really seen the Grim again? Would he? The last thing he needed was another near-fatal accident, with the Quidditch final drawing ever nearer. The Easter holidays were not exactly relaxing. The third years had never had so much homework. Neville Longbottom seemed close to a nervous collapse, and he wasn't the only one. \"Call this a holiday!\" Seamus Finnigan roared at the common room one afternoon. \"The exams are ages away, what're they playing at?\" But nobody had as much to do as Hermione. Even without Divination, she was taking more subjects than anybody else. She was usually last to leave the common room at night, first to arrive at the library the next morning; she had shadows like Lupin's under her eyes, and seemed constantly close to tears. Ron had taken over responsibility for Buckbeak's appeal. When he wasn't doing his own work, he was poring over enormously thick volumes with names like The Handbook of Hippogriff Psychology and Fowl or Foul? A Study of Hippogriff Brutality. He was so absorbed, he even forgot to be horrible to Crookshanks. Harry, meanwhile, had to fit in his homework around Quid-ditch practice every day, not to mention endless discussions of tactics with Wood. The Gryffindor-Slytherin match would take place on the first Saturday after the Easter holidays. Slytherin was leading the tournament by exactly two hundred points. This meant (as Wood constantly reminded his team) that they needed to win the match by more than that amount to win the Cup. It also meant that the burden of winning fell largely on Harry, because capturing the Snitch was worth one hundred and fifty points. \"So you must catch it only if we're more than fifty points up,\" Wood told Harry constantly. \"Only if we're more than fifty points up, Harry, or we win the match but lose the Cup. You've got that, haven't you? You must catch the Snitch only if we're —\" \"I KNOW, OLIVER!\" Harry yelled. The whole of Gryffindor House was obsessed with the coming  match. Gryffindor hadn't won the Quidditch Cup since the legendary Charlie Weasley (Ron's second oldest brother) had been Seeker. But Harry doubted whether any of them, even Wood, wanted to win as much as he did. The enmity between Harry and Malfoy was at its highest point ever. Malfoy was still smarting about the mud-throwing incident in Hogsmeade and was even more furious that Harry had somehow wormed his way out of punishment. Harry hadn't forgotten Malfoy's attempt to sabotage him in the match against Ravenclaw, but it was the matter of Buck-beak that made him most determined to beat Malfoy in front of the entire school. Never, in anyone's memory, had a match approached in such a highly charged atmosphere. By the time the holidays were over, tension between the two teams and their Houses was at the breaking point. A number of small scuffles broke out in the corridors, culminating in a nasty incident in which a Gryffindor fourth year and a Slytherin sixth year ended up in the hospital wing with leeks sprouting out of their ears. Harry was having a particularly bad time of it. He couldn't walk to class without Slytherins sticking out their legs and trying to trip him up; Crabbe and Goyle kept popping up wherever he went, and slouching away looking disappointed when they saw him surrounded by people. Wood had given instructions that Harry should be accompanied everywhere he went, in case the Slytherins tried to put him out of action. The whole of Gryffindor House took up the challenge enthusiastically, so that it was impossible for Harry to get to classes on time because he was surrounded by a vast, chattering crowd. Harry was more concerned for his Firebolt's safety than his own. When he wasn't flying it, he locked it securely in his trunk and frequently dashed back up to Gryffindor Tower at break times to check that it was still there. All usual pursuits were abandoned in the Gryffindor common room the night before the match. Even Hermione had put down her books. \"I can't work, I can't concentrate,\" she said nervously. There was a great deal of noise. Fred and George Weasley were dealing with the pressure by being louder and more exuberant than ever. Oliver Wood was crouched over a model of a Quidditch field in the corner, prodding little figures across it with his wand and muttering to himself. Angelina, Alicia, and Katie were laughing at Fred's and George's jokes. Harry was sitting with Ron and Hermione, removed from the center of things, trying not to think about the next day, because every time he did, he had the horrible sensation that something very large was fighting to get out of his stomach. \"You're going to be fine,\" Hermione told him, though she looked positively terrified. \"You've got a Firebolt!\" said Ron. \"Yeah . . . ,\" said Harry, his stomach writhing. It came as a relief when Wood suddenly stood up and yelled, \"Team! Bed!\" Harry slept badly. First he dreamed that he had overslept, and that Wood was yelling, \"Where were you? We had to use Neville instead!\" Then he dreamed that Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin team arrived for the match riding dragons. He was flying at breakneck speed, trying to avoid a spurt of flames from Malfoy's steed's mouth, when he realized he had forgotten his Firebolt. He fell through the air and woke with a start. It was a few seconds before Harry remembered that the match hadn't taken place yet, that he was safe in bed, and that the Slytherin team definitely wouldn't be allowed to play on dragons. He was feeling very thirsty. Quietly as he could, he got out of his four-poster and went to pour himself some water from the silver jug beneath the window. The grounds were still and quiet. No breath of wind disturbed the treetops in the Forbidden Forest; the Whomping Willow was motionless and innocent-looking. It looked as though the conditions for the match would be perfect. Harry set down his goblet and was about to turn back to his bed when something caught his eye. An animal of some kind was prowling across the silvery lawn. Harry dashed to his bedside table, snatched up his glasses, and put them on, then hurried back to the window. It couldn't be the Grim — not now — not right before the match — He peered out at the grounds again and, after a minute's frantic searching, spotted it. It was skirting the edge of the forest now. . . . It wasn't the Grim at all . . . it was a cat. . . . Harry clutched the window ledge in relief as he recognized the bottlebrush tail. It was only Crookshanks. . . . Or was it only Crookshanks? Harry squinted, pressing his nose flat against the glass. Crookshanks seemed to have come to a halt. Harry was sure he could see something else moving in the shadow of the trees too. And just then, it emerged — a gigantic, shaggy black dog, moving stealthily across the lawn, Crookshanks trotting at its side. Harry stared. What did this mean? If Crookshanks could see the dog as well, how could it be an omen of Harry's death? \"Ron!\" Harry hissed. \"Ron! Wake up!\" \"Huh?\" \"I need you to tell me if you can see something!\" \"S'all dark, Harry,\" Ron muttered thickly. \"What're you on about?\" \"Down here —\" Harry looked quickly back out of the window. Crookshanks and the dog had vanished. Harry climbed onto the windowsill to look right down into the shadows of the castle, but they weren't there. Where had they gone? A loud snore told him Ron had fallen asleep again. Harry and the rest of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall the next day to enormous applause. Harry couldn't help grinning broadly as he saw that both the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were applauding them too. The Slytherin table hissed loudly as they passed. Harry noticed that Malfoy looked even paler than usual. Wood spent the whole of breakfast urging his team to eat, while touching nothing himself. Then he hurried them off to the field before anyone else had finished, so they could get an idea of the conditions. As they left the Great Hall, everyone applauded again. \"Good luck, Harry!\" called Cho. Harry felt himself blushing. \"Okay — no wind to speak of — sun's a bit bright, that could  impair your vision, watch out for it — ground's fairly hard, good, that'll give us a fast kickoff —\" Wood paced the field, staring around with the team behind him. Finally, they saw the front doors of the castle open in the distance and the rest of the school spilling onto the lawn. \"Locker rooms,\" said Wood tersely. None of them spoke as they changed into their scarlet robes. Harry wondered if they were feeling like he was: as though he'd eaten something extremely wriggly for breakfast. In what seemed like no time at all, Wood was saying, \"Okay, it's time, let's go —\" They walked out onto the field to a tidal wave of noise. Three-quarters of the crowd was wearing scarlet rosettes, waving scarlet flags with the Gryffindor lion upon them, or brandishing banners with slogans like \"GO GRYFFINDOR!\" and \"LIONS FOR THE CUP!\" Behind the Slytherin goal posts, however, two hundred people were wearing green; the silver serpent of Slytherin glittered on their flags, and Professor Snape sat in the very front row, wearing green like everyone else, and a very grim smile. \"And here are the Gryffindors!\" yelled Lee Jordan, who was acting as commentator as usual. \"Potter, Bell, Johnson, Spinnet, Weasley, Weasley, and Wood. Widely acknowledged as the best team Hogwarts has seen in a good few years —\" Lee's comments were drowned by a tide of \"boos\" from the Slytherin end. \"And here come the Slytherin team, led by Captain Flint. He's made some changes in the lineup and seems to be going for size rather than skill —\" More boos from the Slytherin crowd. Harry, however, thought Lee had a point. Malfoy was easily the smallest person on the Slytherin team; the rest of them were enormous. \"Captains, shake hands!\" said Madam Hooch. Flint and Wood approached each other and grasped each other's hand very tightly; it looked as though each was trying to break the other's fingers. \"Mount your brooms!\" said Madam Hooch. \"Three . . . two . . . one . . .\" The sound of her whistle was lost in the roar from the crowd as fourteen brooms rose into the air. Harry felt his hair fly back off his forehead; his nerves left him in the thrill of the flight; he glanced around, saw Malfoy on his tail, and sped off in search of the Snitch. \"And it's Gryffindor in possession, Alicia Spinnet of Gryffindor with the Quaffle, heading straight for the Slytherin goal posts, looking good, Alicia! Argh, no — Quaffle intercepted by Warring-ton, Warrington of Slytherin tearing up the field — WHAM! — nice Bludger work there by George Weasley, Warrington drops the Quaffle, it's caught by — Johnson, Gryffindor back in possession, come on, Angelina — nice swerve around Montague — duck, Angelina, that's a Bludger! — SHE SCORES! TEN&ndash;ZERO TO GRYFFINDOR!\" Angelina punched the air as she soared around the end of the field; the sea of scarlet below was screaming its delight — \"OUCH!\" Angelina was nearly thrown from her broom as Marcus Flint went smashing into her. \"Sorry!\" said Flint as the crowd below booed. \"Sorry, didn't see her!\" A moment later, Fred Weasley chucked his Beater's club at the back of Flint's head. Flint's nose smashed into the handle of his broom and began to bleed. \"That will do!\" shrieked Madam Hooch, zooming between them. \"Penalty shot to Gryffindor for an unprovoked attack on their Chaser! Penalty shot to Slytherin for deliberate damage to their Chaser!\" \"Come off it, Miss!\" howled Fred, but Madam Hooch blew her whistle and Alicia flew forward to take the penalty. \"Come on, Alicia!\" yelled Lee into the silence that had descended on the crowd. \"YES! SHE'S BEATEN THE KEEPER! TWENTY&ndash;ZERO TO GRYFFINDOR!\" Harry turned the Firebolt sharply to watch Flint, still bleeding freely, fly forward to take the Slytherin penalty. Wood was hovering in front of the Gryffindor goal posts, his jaw clenched. \" 'Course, Wood's a superb Keeper!\" Lee Jordan told the crowd as Flint waited for Madam Hooch's whistle. \"Superb! Very difficult to pass — very difficult indeed — YES! I DON'T BELIEVE IT! HE'S SAVED IT!\" Relieved, Harry zoomed away, gazing around for the Snitch, but still making sure he caught every word of Lee's commentary. It was essential that he hold Malfoy off the Snitch until Gryffindor was more than fifty points up — \"Gryffindor in possession, no, Slytherin in possession — no! — Gryffindor back in possession and it's Katie Bell, Katie Bell for Gryffindor with the Quaffle, she's streaking up the field — THAT WAS DELIBERATE!\" Montague, a Slytherin Chaser, had swerved in front of Katie,  and instead of seizing the Quaffle had grabbed her head. Katie cartwheeled in the air, managed to stay on her broom, but dropped the Quaffle. Madam Hooch's whistle rang out again as she soared over to Montague and began shouting at him. A minute later, Katie had put another penalty past the Slytherin Seeker. \"THIRTY&ndash;ZERO! TAKE THAT, YOU DIRTY, CHEATING —\" \"Jordan, if you can't commentate in an unbiased way — !\" \"I'm telling it like it is, Professor!\" Harry felt a huge jolt of excitement. He had seen the Snitch — it was shimmering at the foot of one of the Gryffindor goal posts — but he mustn't catch it yet — and if Malfoy saw it — Faking a look of sudden concentration, Harry pulled his Fire-bolt around and sped off toward the Slytherin end — it worked. Malfoy went haring after him, clearly thinking Harry had seen the Snitch there. . . . WHOOSH. One of the Bludgers came streaking past Harry's right ear, hit by the gigantic Slytherin Beater, Derrick. Then again — WHOOSH. The second Bludger grazed Harry's elbow. The other Beater, Bole, was closing in. Harry had a fleeting glimpse of Bole and Derrick zooming toward him, clubs raised — He turned the Firebolt upward at the last second, and Bole and Derrick collided with a sickening crunch. \"Ha haaa!\" yelled Lee Jordan as the Slytherin Beaters lurched away from each other, clutching their heads. \"Too bad, boys! You'll need to get up earlier than that to beat a Firebolt! And it's Gryffindor in possession again, as Johnson takes the Quaffle — Flint alongside her — poke him in the eye, Angelina! — it was a joke, Professor, it was a joke — oh no — Flint in possession, Flint flying toward the Gryffindor goal posts, come on now, Wood, save — !\" But Flint had scored; there was an eruption of cheers from the Slytherin end, and Lee swore so badly that Professor McGonagall tried to tug the magical megaphone away from him. \"Sorry, Professor, sorry! Won't happen again! So, Gryffindor in the lead, thirty points to ten, and Gryffindor in possession —\" It was turning into the dirtiest game Harry had ever played in. Enraged that Gryffindor had taken such an early lead, the Slytherins were rapidly resorting to any means to take the Quaffle. Bole hit Alicia with his club and tried to say he'd thought she was a Bludger. George Weasley elbowed Bole in the face in retaliation. Madam Hooch awarded both teams penalties, and Wood pulled off another spectacular save, making the score forty-ten to Gryffindor. The Snitch had disappeared again. Malfoy was still keeping close to Harry as he soared over the match, looking around for it — once Gryffindor was fifty points ahead — Katie scored. Fifty-ten. Fred and George Weasley were swooping around her, clubs raised, in case any of the Slytherins were thinking of revenge. Bole and Derrick took advantage of Fred's and George's absence to aim both Bludgers at Wood; they caught him in the stomach, one after the other, and he rolled over in the air, clutching his broom, completely winded. Madam Hooch was beside herself. \"YOU DO NOT ATTACK THE KEEPER UNLESS THE QUAFFLE IS WITHIN THE SCORING AREA!\" she shrieked at Bole and Derrick. \"Gryffindor penalty!\" And Angelina scored. Sixty-ten. Moments later, Fred Weasley pelted a Bludger at Warrington, knocking the Quaffle out of his hands; Alicia seized it and put it through the Slytherin goal — seventy-ten. The Gryffindor crowd below was screaming itself hoarse — Gryffindor was sixty points in the lead, and if Harry caught the Snitch now, the Cup was theirs. Harry could almost feel hundreds of eyes following him as he soared around the field, high above the rest of the game, with Malfoy speeding along behind him. And then he saw it. The Snitch was sparkling twenty feet above him. Harry put on a huge burst of speed; the wind was roaring in his ears; he stretched out his hand, but suddenly, the Firebolt was slowing down — Horrified, he looked around. Malfoy had thrown himself forward, grabbed hold of the Firebolt's tail, and was pulling it back. \"You —\" Harry was angry enough to hit Malfoy, but couldn't reach — Malfoy was panting with the effort of holding onto the Firebolt, but his eyes were sparkling maliciously. He had achieved what he'd wanted to do — the Snitch had disappeared again. \"Penalty! Penalty to Gryffindor! I've never seen such tactics!\" Madam Hooch screeched, shooting up to where Malfoy was sliding back onto his Nimbus Two Thousand and One. \"YOU CHEATING SCUM!\" Lee Jordan was howling into the megaphone, dancing out of Professor McGonagall's reach. \"YOU FILTHY, CHEATING B —\" Professor McGonagall didn't even bother to tell him off. She was actually shaking her finger in Malfoy's direction, her hat had fallen off, and she too was shouting furiously. Alicia took Gryffindor's penalty, but she was so angry she missed by several feet. The Gryffindor team was losing concentration and the Slytherins, delighted by Malfoy's foul on Harry, were being spurred on to greater heights. \"Slytherin in possession, Slytherin heading for goal — Montague scores —\" Lee groaned. \"Seventy-twenty to Gryffindor. . . .\" Harry was now marking Malfoy so closely their knees kept hitting each other. Harry wasn't going to let Malfoy anywhere near the Snitch. . . . \"Get out of it, Potter!\" Malfoy yelled in frustration as he tried to turn and found Harry blocking him. \"Angelina Johnson gets the Quaffle for Gryffindor, come on, Angelina, COME ON!\" Harry looked around. Every single Slytherin player apart from Malfoy was streaking up the pitch toward Angelina, including the Slytherin Keeper — they were all going to block her — Harry wheeled the Firebolt around, bent so low he was lying flat along the handle, and kicked it forward. Like a bullet, he shot toward the Slytherins. \"AAAAAAARRRGH!\" They scattered as the Firebolt zoomed toward them; Angelina's way was clear. \"SHE SCORES! SHE SCORES! Gryffindor leads by eighty points to twenty!\" Harry, who had almost pelted headlong into the stands, skidded to a halt in midair, reversed, and zoomed back into the middle of the field. And then he saw something to make his heart stand still. Malfoy was diving, a look of triumph on his face — there, a few feet above the grass below, was a tiny, golden glimmer — Harry urged the Firebolt downward, but Malfoy was miles ahead — \"Go! Go! Go!\" Harry urged his broom. He was gaining on Malfoy — Harry flattened himself to the broom handle as Bole sent a Bludger at him — he was at Malfoy's ankles — he was level — Harry threw himself forward, took both hands off his broom. He knocked Malfoy's arm out of the way and — \"YES!\" He pulled out of his dive, his hand in the air, and the stadium exploded. Harry soared above the crowd, an odd ringing in his ears. The tiny golden ball was held tight in his fist, beating its wings hopelessly against his fingers. Then Wood was speeding toward him, half-blinded by tears; he seized Harry around the neck and sobbed unrestrainedly into his shoulder. Harry felt two large thumps as Fred and George hit them; then Angelina's, Alicia's, and Katie's voices, \"We've won the Cup! We've won the Cup!\" Tangled together in a many-armed hug, the Gryffindor team sank, yelling hoarsely, back to earth. Wave upon wave of crimson supporters was pouring over the barriers onto the field. Hands were raining down on their backs. Harry had a confused impression of noise and bodies pressing in on him. Then he, and the rest of the team, were hoisted onto the shoulders of the crowd. Thrust into the light, he saw Hagrid, plastered with crimson rosettes — \"Yeh beat 'em, Harry, yeh beat 'em! Wait till I tell Buckbeak!\" There was Percy, jumping up and down like a maniac, all dignity forgotten. Professor McGonagall was sobbing harder even than Wood, wiping her eyes with an enormous Gryffindor flag; and there, fighting their way toward Harry, were Ron and Hermione. Words failed them. They simply beamed as Harry was borne toward the stands, where Dumbledore stood waiting with the enormous Quidditch Cup. If only there had been a dementor around. . . . As a sobbing Wood passed Harry the Cup, as he lifted it into the air, Harry felt he could have produced the world's best Patronus.\n",

      "It took a few seconds for the absurdity of this statement to sink in. Then Ron voiced what Harry was thinking. \"You're both mental.\" \"Ridiculous!\" said Hermione faintly. \"Peter Pettigrew's dead!\" said Harry. \"He killed him twelve years ago!\" He pointed at Black, whose face twitched convulsively. \"I meant to,\" he growled, his yellow teeth bared, \"but little Peter got the better of me . . . not this time, though!\" And Crookshanks was thrown to the floor as Black lunged at Scabbers; Ron yelled with pain as Black's weight fell on his broken leg. \"Sirius, NO!\" Lupin yelled, launching himself forwards and dragging Black away from Ron again, \"WAIT! You can't do it just like that — they need to understand — we've got to explain —\" \"We can explain afterwards!\" snarled Black, trying to throw Lupin off. One hand was still clawing the air as it tried to reach Scabbers, who was squealing like a piglet, scratching Ron's face and neck as he tried to escape. \"They've — got — a — right — to — know — everything!\" Lupin panted, still trying to restrain Black. \"Ron's kept him as a pet! There are parts of it even I don't understand! And Harry — you owe Harry the truth, Sirius!\" Black stopped struggling, though his hollowed eyes were still fixed on Scabbers, who was clamped tightly under Ron's bitten, scratched, and bleeding hands. \"All right, then,\" Black said, without taking his eyes off the rat. \"Tell them whatever you like. But make it quick, Remus. I want to commit the murder I was imprisoned for. . . .\" \"You're nutters, both of you,\" said Ron shakily, looking round at Harry and Hermione for support. \"I've had enough of this. I'm off.\" He tried to heave himself up on his good leg, but Lupin raised his wand again, pointing it at Scabbers. \"You're going to hear me out, Ron,\" he said quietly. \"Just keep a tight hold on Peter while you listen.\" \"HE'S NOT PETER, HE'S SCABBERS!\" Ron yelled, trying to force the rat back into his front pocket, but Scabbers was fighting too hard; Ron swayed and overbalanced, and Harry caught him and pushed him back down to the bed. Then, ignoring Black, Harry turned to Lupin. \"There were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die,\" he said. \"A whole street full of them . . .\"MOODY, WORMTAIL, PADFOOT, AND PRONGS \"They didn't see what they thought they saw!\" said Black savagely, still watching Scabbers struggling in Ron's hands. \"Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter,\" said Lupin, nodding. \"I believed it myself — until I saw the map tonight. Because the Marauder's map never lies . . . Peter's alive. Ron's holding him, Harry.\" Harry looked down at Ron, and as their eyes met, they agreed, silently: Black and Lupin were both out of their minds. Their story made no sense whatsoever. How could Scabbers be Peter Pettigrew? Azkaban must have unhinged Black after all — but why was Lupin playing along with him? Then Hermione spoke, in a trembling, would-be calm sort of voice, as though trying to will Professor Lupin to talk sensibly. \"But Professor Lupin . . . Scabbers can't be Pettigrew . . . it just can't be true, you know it can't . . .\" \"Why can't it be true?\" Lupin said calmly, as though they were in class, and Hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experiment with grindylows. \"Because . . . because people would know if Peter Pettigrew had been an Animagus. We did Animagi in class with Professor McGonagall. And I looked them up when I did my homework — the Ministry of Magic keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become animals; there's a register showing what animal they become, and their markings and things . . . and I went and looked Professor McGonagall up on the register, and there have been only seven Animagi this century, and Pettigrew's name wasn't on the list —\" Harry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the effort Hermione put into her homework, when Lupin started to laugh.  \"Right again, Hermione!\" he said. \"But the Ministry never knew that there used to be three unregistered Animagi running around Hogwarts.\" \"If you're going to tell them the story, get a move on, Remus,\" snarled Black, who was still watching Scabbers's every desperate move. \"I've waited twelve years, I'm not going to wait much longer.\" \"All right . . . but you'll need to help me, Sirius,\" said Lupin, \"I only know how it began . . .\" Lupin broke off. There had been a loud creak behind him. The bedroom door had opened of its own accord. All five of them stared at it. Then Lupin strode toward it and looked out into the landing. \"No one there . . .\" \"This place is haunted!\" said Ron. \"It's not,\" said Lupin, still looking at the door in a puzzled way. \"The Shrieking Shack was never haunted. . . . The screams and howls the villagers used to hear were made by me.\" He pushed his graying hair out of his eyes, thought for a moment, then said, \"That's where all of this starts — with my becoming a werewolf. None of this could have happened if I hadn't been bitten . . . and if I hadn't been so foolhardy. . . .\" He looked sober and tired. Ron started to interrupt, but Hermione said, \"Shh!\" She was watching Lupin very intently. \"I was a very small boy when I received the bite. My parents tried everything, but in those days there was no cure. The potion that Professor Snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery. It makes me safe, you see. As long as I take it in the week MOODY, WORMTAIL, PADFOOT, AND PRONGS preceding the full moon, I keep my mind when I transform. . . . I am able to curl up in my office, a harmless wolf, and wait for the moon to wane again. \"Before the Wolfsbane Potion was discovered, however, I became a fully fledged monster once a month. It seemed impossible that I would be able to come to Hogwarts. Other parents weren't likely to want their children exposed to me. \"But then Dumbledore became Headmaster, and he was sympathetic. He said that as long as we took certain precautions, there was no reason I shouldn't come to school. . . .\" Lupin sighed, and looked directly at Harry. \"I told you, months ago, that the Whomping Willow was planted the year I came to Hogwarts. The truth is that it was planted because I came to Hogwarts. This house\" — Lupin looked miserably around the room, — \"the tunnel that leads to it — they were built for my use. Once a month, I was smuggled out of the castle, into this place, to transform. The tree was placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across me while I was dangerous.\" Harry couldn't see where this story was going, but he was listening raptly all the same. The only sound apart from Lupin's voice was Scabbers's frightened squeaking. \"My transformations in those days were — were terrible. It is very painful to turn into a werewolf. I was separated from humans to bite, so I bit and scratched myself instead. The villagers heard the noise and the screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violent spirits. Dumbledore encouraged the rumor. . . . Even now, when the house has been silent for years, the villagers don't dare approach it. . . . \"But apart from my transformations, I was happier than I had ever been in my life. For the first time ever, I had friends, three great friends. Sirius Black . . . Peter Pettigrew . . . and, of course, your father, Harry — James Potter. \"Now, my three friends could hardly fail to notice that I disappeared once a month. I made up all sorts of stories. I told them my mother was ill, and that I had to go home to see her. . . . I was terrified they would desert me the moment they found out what I was. But of course, they, like you, Hermione, worked out the truth. . . . \"And they didn't desert me at all. Instead, they did something for me that would make my transformations not only bearable, but the best times of my life. They became Animagi.\" \"My dad too?\" said Harry, astounded. \"Yes, indeed,\" said Lupin. \"It took them the best part of three years to work out how to do it. Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest students in the school, and lucky they were, because the Animagus transformation can go horribly wrong — one reason the Ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it. Peter needed all the help he could get from James and Sirius. Finally, in our fifth year, they managed it. They could each turn into a different animal at will.\" \"But how did that help you?\" said Hermione, sounding puzzled. \"They couldn't keep me company as humans, so they kept me company as animals,\" said Lupin. \"A werewolf is only a danger to people. They sneaked out of the castle every month under James's Invisibility Cloak. They transformed . . . Peter, as the smallest, could slip beneath the Willow's attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it. They would then slip down the tunnel and joinMOODY, WORMTAIL, PADFOOT, AND PRONGS me. Under their influence, I became less dangerous. My body was still wolfish, but my mind seemed to become less so while I was with them.\" \"Hurry up, Remus,\" snarled Black, who was still watching Scabbers with a horrible sort of hunger on his face. \"I'm getting there, Sirius, I'm getting there . . . well, highly exciting possibilities were open to us now that we could all transform. Soon we were leaving the Shrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and the village by night. Sirius and James transformed into such large animals, they were able to keep a werewolf in check. I doubt whether any Hogwarts students ever found out more about the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade than we did. . . . And that's how we came to write the Marauder's Map, and sign it with our nicknames. Sirius is Padfoot. Peter is Wormtail. James was Prongs.\" \"What sort of animal — ?\" Harry began, but Hermione cut him off. \"That was still really dangerous! Running around in the dark with a werewolf! What if you'd given the others the slip, and bitten somebody?\" \"A thought that still haunts me,\" said Lupin heavily. \"And there were near misses, many of them. We laughed about them afterwards. We were young, thoughtless — carried away with our own cleverness.\" \"I sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore's trust, of course . . . he had admitted me to Hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done so, and he had no idea I was breaking the rules he had set down for my own and others' safety. He never knew I had led three fellow students into becoming Animagi illegally. But I always managed to forget my guilty feelings every time we sat down to plan our next month's adventure. And I haven't changed . . . Lupin's face had hardened, and there was self-disgust in his voice. \"All this year, I have been battling with myself, wondering whether I should tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus. But I didn't do it. Why? Because I was too cowardly. It would have meant admitting that I'd betrayed his trust while I was at school, admitting that I'd led others along with me . . . and Dumbledore's trust has meant everything to me. He let me into Hogwarts as a boy, and he gave me a job when I have been shunned all my adult life, unable to find paid work because of what I am. And so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he learned from Voldemort, that being an Animagus had nothing to do with it . . . so, in a way, Snape's been right about me all along.\" \"Snape?\" said Black harshly, taking his eyes off Scabbers for the first time in minutes and looking up at Lupin. \"What's Snape got to do with it?\" \"He's here, Sirius,\" said Lupin heavily. \"He's teaching here as well.\" He looked up at Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"Professor Snape was at school with us. He fought very hard against my appointment to the Defense Against the Dark Arts job. He has been telling Dumbledore all year that I am not to be trusted. He has his reasons . . . you see, Sirius here played a trick on him which nearly killed him, a trick which involved me —\" Black made a derisive noise. \"It served him right,\" he sneered. \"Sneaking around, trying to find out what we were up to . . . hoping he could get us expelled. . . .\"MOODY, WORMTAIL, PADFOOT, AND PRONGS \"Severus was very interested in where I went every month.\" Lupin told Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"We were in the same year, you know, and we — er — didn't like each other very much. He especially disliked James. Jealous, I think, of James's talent on the Quidditch field . . . anyway Snape had seen me crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one evening as she led me toward the Whomping Willow to transform. Sirius thought it would be — er — amusing, to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick, and he'd be able to get in after me. Well, of course, Snape tried it — if he'd got as far as this house, he'd have met a fully grown werewolf — but your father, who'd heard what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled him back, at great risk to his life . . . Snape glimpsed me, though, at the end of the tunnel. He was forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody, but from that time on he knew what I was. . . .\" \"So that's why Snape doesn't like you,\" said Harry slowly, \"because he thought you were in on the joke?\" \"That's right,\" sneered a cold voice from the wall behind Lupin. Severus Snape was pulling off the Invisibility Cloak, his wand pointing directly at Lupin.\n",

      "Harry turned to look at Ron and Hermione. Neither of them seemed to have understood what Xenophilius had said either. \"The Deathly Hallows?\" \"That's right,\" said Xenophilius. \"You haven't heard of them? I'm not surprised. Very, very few wizards believe. Witness that knuckle-headed young man at your brother's wedding,\" he nodded at Ron, \"who attacked me for sporting the symbol of a well-known Dark wizard! Such ignorance. There is nothing Dark about the Hallows — at least, not in that crude sense. One simply uses the symbol to reveal oneself to other believers, in the hope that they might help one with the Quest.\" He stirred several lumps of sugar into his Gurdyroot infusion and drank some. \"I'm sorry,\" said Harry. \"I still don't really understand.\" To be polite, he took a sip from his cup too, and almost gagged: The stuff was quite disgusting, as though someone had liquidized bogey-flavored Every Flavor Beans. \"Well, you see, believers seek the Deathly Hallows,\" said Xenophilius, smacking his lips in apparent appreciation of the Gurdyroot infusion. \"But what are the Deathly Hallows?\" asked Hermione. Xenophilius set aside his empty teacup. \"I assume that you are all familiar with \"The Tale of the Three Brothers'?\" Harry said, \"No,\" but Ron and Hermione both said, \"Yes.\" Xenophilius nodded gravely. \"Well, well, Mr. Potter, the whole thing starts with 'The Tale of the Three Brothers' . . . I have a copy somewhere. . . .\" He glanced vaguely around the room, at the piles of parchment and books, but Hermione said, \"I've got a copy, Mr. Lovegood, I've got it right here.\" And she pulled out The Tales of Beedle the Bard from the small, beaded bag. \"The original?\" inquired Xenophilius sharply, and when she nodded, he said, \"Well then, why don't you read it aloud? Much the best way to make sure we all understand.\" \"Er . . . all right,\" said Hermione nervously. She opened the book, and Harry saw that the symbol they were investigating headed the top of the page as she gave a little cough, and began to read. \"'There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight —' \" \"Midnight, our mum always told us,\" said Ron, who had stretched out, arms behind his head, to listen. Hermione shot him a look of annoyance. \"Sorry, I just think it's a bit spookier if it's midnight!\" said Ron. \"Yeah, because we really need a bit more fear in our lives,\" said Harry before he could stop himself. Xenophilius did not seem to be paying much attention, but was staring out of the window at the sky. \"Go on, Hermione.\" \"'In time, the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through and too dangerous to swim across. However, these brothers were learned in the magical arts, and so they simply waved their wands and made a bridge appear across the treacherous water. They were halfway across it when they found their path blocked by a hooded figure. \"'And Death spoke to them —'\" \"Sorry,\" interjected Harry, \"but Death spoke to them?\" \"It's a fairy tale, Harry!\" \"Right, sorry. Go on.\" \"'And Death spoke to them. He was angry that he had been cheated out of three new victims, for travelers usually drowned in the river. But Death was cunning. He pretended to congratulate the three brothers upon their magic, and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him. \"'So the oldest brother, who was a combative man, asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence: a wand that must always win duels for its owner, a wand worthy of a wizard who had conquered Death! So Death crossed to an elder tree on the banks of the river, fashioned a wand from a branch that hung there, and gave it to the oldest brother. \"'Then the second brother, who was an arrogant man, decided that he wanted to humiliate Death still further, and asked for the power to recall others from Death. So Death picked up a stone from the riverbank and gave it to the second brother, and told him that the stone would have the power to bring back the dead. \"'And then Death asked the third and youngest brother what he would like. The youngest brother was the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers, and he did not trust Death. So he asked for something that would enable him to go forth from that place without being followed by Death. And Death, most unwillingly, handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.'\" \"Death's got an Invisibility Cloak?\" Harry interrupted again. \"So he can sneak up on people,\" said Ron. \"Sometimes he gets bored of running at them, flapping his arms and shrieking . . . sorry, Hermione.\" \"'Then Death stood aside and allowed the three brothers to continue on their way, and they did so, talking with wonder of the adventure they had had, and admiring Death's gifts. \"'In due course the brothers separated, each for his own destination. \"'The first brother traveled on for a week or more, and reaching a distant village, sought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel. Naturally, with the Elder Wand as his weapon, he could not fail to win the duel that followed. Leaving his enemy dead upon the floor, the oldest brother proceeded to an inn, where he boasted loudly of the powerful wand he had snatched from Death himself, and of how it made him invincible. \"'That very night, another wizard crept upon the oldest brother as he lay, wine-sodden, upon his bed. The thief took the wand and, for good measure, slit the oldest brother's throat. \"'And so Death took the first brother for his own. \"'Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his own home, where he lived alone. Here he took out the stone that had the power to recall the dead, and turned it thrice in his hand. To his amazement and his delight, the figure of the girl he had once hoped to marry, before her untimely death, appeared at once before him. \"'Yet she was sad and cold, separated from him as by a veil. Though she had returned to the mortal world, she did not truly belong there and suffered. Finally the second brother, driven mad with hopeless longing, killed himself so as truly to join her. \"'And so Death took the second brother for his own. \"'But though Death searched for the third brother for many years, he was never able to find him. It was only when he had attained a great age that the youngest brother finally took off the Cloak of Invisibility and gave it to his son. And then he greeted Death as an old friend, and went with him gladly, and, equals, they departed this life.'\" Hermione closed the book. It was a moment or two before Xenophilius seemed to realize that she had stopped reading, then he withdrew his gaze from the window and said, \"Well, there you are.\" \"Sorry?\" said Hermione, sounding confused. \"Those are the Deathly Hallows,\" said Xenophilius. He picked up a quill from a packed table at his elbow, and pulled a torn piece of parchment from between more books. \"The Elder Wand,\" he said, and he drew a straight vertical line upon the parchment. \"The Resurrection Stone,\" he said, and he added a circle on top of the line. \"The Cloak of Invisibility,\" he finished, enclosing both line and circle in a triangle, to make the symbol that so intrigued Hermione. \"Together,\" he said, \"the Deathly Hallows.\" \"But there's no mention of the words 'Deathly Hallows' in the story,\" said Hermione. \"Well, of course not,\" said Xenophilius, maddeningly smug. \"That is a children's tale, told to amuse rather than to instruct. Those of us  who understand these matters, however, recognize that the ancient story refers to three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master of Death.\" There was a short silence in which Xenophilius glanced out of the window. Already the sun was low in the sky. \"Luna ought to have enough Plimpies soon,\" he said quietly. \"When you say 'master of Death' —\" said Ron. \"Master,\" said Xenophilius, waving an airy hand. \"Conqueror. Vanquisher. Whichever term you prefer.\" \"But then . . . do you mean . . .\" said Hermione slowly, and Harry could tell that she was trying to keep any trace of skepticism out of her voice, \"that you believe these objects — these Hallows — actually exist?\" Xenophilius raised his eyebrows again. \"Well, of course.\" \"But,\" said Hermione, and Harry could hear her restraint starting to crack, \"Mr. Lovegood, how can you possibly believe — ?\" \"Luna has told me all about you, young lady,\" said Xenophilius. \"You are, I gather, not unintelligent, but painfully limited. Narrow. Close-minded.\" \"Perhaps you ought to try on the hat, Hermione,\" said Ron, nodding toward the ludicrous headdress. His voice shook with the strain of not laughing. \"Mr. Lovegood,\" Hermione began again. \"We all know that there are such things as Invisibility Cloaks. They are rare, but they exist. But —\" \"Ah, but the Third Hallow is a true Cloak of Invisibility, Miss Granger! I mean to say, it is not a traveling cloak imbued with a Disillusionment Charm, or carrying a Bedazzling Hex, or else woven from Demiguise hair, which will hide one initially but fade with the years until it turns opaque. We are talking about a cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it. How many cloaks have you ever seen like that, Miss Granger?\" Hermione opened her mouth to answer, then closed it again, looking more confused than ever. She, Harry, and Ron glanced at one another, and Harry knew that they were all thinking the same thing. It so happened that a cloak exactly like the one Xenophilius had just described was in the room with them at that very moment. \"Exactly,\" said Xenophilius, as if he had defeated them all in reasoned argument. \"None of you have ever seen such a thing. The possessor would be immeasurably rich, would he not?\" He glanced out of the window again. The sky was now tinged with the faintest trace of pink. \"All right,\" said Hermione, disconcerted. \"Say the Cloak existed . . . what about the stone, Mr. Lovegood? The thing you call the Resurrection Stone?\" \"What of it?\" \"Well, how can that be real?\" \"Prove that it is not,\" said Xenophilius. Hermione looked outraged. \"But that's — I'm sorry, but that's completely ridiculous! How can I possibly prove it doesn't exist? Do you expect me to get hold of — of all the pebbles in the world and test them? I mean, you could claim that anything's real if the only basis for believing in it is that nobody's proved it doesn't exist!\" \"Yes, you could,\" said Xenophilius. \"I am glad to see that you are opening your mind a little.\" \"So the Elder Wand,\" said Harry quickly, before Hermione could retort, \"you think that exists too?\" \"Oh, well, in that case there is endless evidence,\" said Xenophilius. \"The Elder Wand is the Hallow that is most easily traced, because of the way in which it passes from hand to hand.\" \"Which is what?\" asked Harry. \"Which is that the possessor of the wand must capture it from its previous owner, if he is to be truly master of it,\" said Xenophilius. \"Surely you have heard of the way the wand came to Egbert the Egregious, after his slaughter of Emeric the Evil? Of how Godelot died in his own cellar after his son, Hereward, took the wand from him? Of the dreadful Loxias, who took the wand from Barnabas Deverill, whom he had killed? The bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history.\" Harry glanced at Hermione. She was frowning at Xenophilius, but she did not contradict him. \"So where do you think the Elder Wand is now?\" asked Ron. \"Alas, who knows?\" said Xenophilius, as he gazed out of the window. \"Who knows where the Elder Wand lies hidden? The trail goes cold with Arcus and Livius. Who can say which of them really defeated Loxias, and which took the wand? And who can say who may have defeated them? History, alas, does not tell us.\" There was a pause. Finally Hermione asked stiffly, \"Mr. Love-good, does the Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?\" Xenophilius looked taken aback as something shifted in Harry's  memory, but he could not locate it. Peverell . . . he had heard that name before. . . . \"But you have been misleading me, young woman!\" said Xenophilius, now sitting up much straighter in his chair and goggling at Hermione. \"I thought you were new to the Hallows Quest! Many of us Questers believe that the Peverells have everything — everything! — to do with the Hallows!\" \"Who are the Peverells?\" asked Ron. \"That was the name on the grave with the mark on it, in Godric's Hollow,\" said Hermione, still watching Xenophilius. \"Ignotus Peverell.\" \"Exactly!\" said Xenophilius, his forefinger raised pedantically. \"The sign of the Deathly Hallows on Ignotus's grave is conclusive proof!\" \"Of what?\" asked Ron. \"Why, that the three brothers in the story were actually the three Peverell brothers, Antioch, Cadmus, and Ignotus! That they were the original owners of the Hallows!\" With another glance at the window he got to his feet, picked up the tray, and headed for the spiral staircase. \"You will stay for dinner?\" he called, as he vanished downstairs again. \"Everybody always requests our recipe for Freshwater Plimpy soup.\" \"Probably to show the Poisoning Department at St. Mungo's,\" said Ron under his breath. Harry waited until they could hear Xenophilius moving about in the kitchen downstairs before speaking. \"What do you think?\" he asked Hermione. \"Oh, Harry,\" she said wearily, \"it's a pile of utter rubbish. This can't be what the sign really means. This must just be his weird take on it. What a waste of time.\" \"I s'pose this is the man who brought us Crumple-Horned Snorkacks,\" said Ron. \"You don't believe it either?\" Harry asked him. \"Nah, that story's just one of those things you tell kids to teach them lessons, isn't it? 'Don't go looking for trouble, don't pick fights, don't go messing around with stuff that's best left alone! Just keep your head down, mind your own business, and you'll be okay' Come to think of it,\" Ron added, \"maybe that story's why elder wands are supposed to be unlucky.\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"One of those superstitions, isn't it? 'May-born witches will marry Muggles.' 'Jinx by twilight, undone by midnight.' 'Wand of elder, never prosper.' You must've heard them. My mum's full of them.\" \"Harry and I were raised by Muggles,\" Hermione reminded him. \"We were taught different superstitions.\" She sighed deeply as a rather pungent smell drifted up from the kitchen. The one good thing about her exasperation with Xenophilius was that it seemed to have made her forget that she was annoyed at Ron. \"I think you're right,\" she told him. \"It's just a morality tale, it's obvious which gift is best, which one you'd choose —\" The three of them spoke at the same time; Hermione said, \"the Cloak,\" Ron said, \"the wand,\" and Harry said, \"the stone.\" They looked at each other, half surprised, half amused. \"You're supposed to say the Cloak,\" Ron told Hermione, \"but you wouldn't need to be invisible if you had the wand. An unbeatable wand, Hermione, come on!\" \"We've already got an Invisibility Cloak,\" said Harry. \"And it's helped us rather a lot, in case you hadn't noticed!\" said Hermione. \"Whereas the wand would be bound to attract trouble —\" \"Only if you shouted about it,\" argued Ron. \"Only if you were prat enough to go dancing around, waving it over your head, and singing, 'I've got an unbeatable wand, come and have a go if you think you're hard enough.' As long as you kept your trap shut —\" \"Yes, but could you keep your trap shut?\" said Hermione, looking skeptical. \"You know, the only true thing he said to us was that there have been stories about extra-powerful wands for hundreds of years.\" \"There have?\" asked Harry. Hermione looked exasperated: The expression was so endearingly familiar that Harry and Ron grinned at each other. \"The Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, they crop up under different names through the centuries, usually in the possession of some Dark wizard who's boasting about them. Professor Binns mentioned some of them, but — oh, it's all nonsense. Wands are only as powerful as the wizards who use them. Some wizards just like to boast that theirs are bigger and better than other people's.\" \"But how do you know,\" said Harry, \"that those wands — the Deathstick and the Wand of Destiny — aren't the same wand, surfacing over the centuries under different names?\" \"What, and they're all really the Elder Wand, made by Death?\" said Ron. Harry laughed: The strange idea that had occurred to him was, after all, ridiculous. His wand, he reminded himself, had been of holly, not elder, and it had been made by Ollivander, whatever it had done that night Voldemort had pursued him across the skies. And if it had been unbeatable, how could it have been broken? \"So why would you take the stone?\" Ron asked him. \"Well, if you could bring people back, we could have Sirius . . . Mad-Eye . . . Dumbledore . . . my parents. . . .\" Neither Ron nor Hermione smiled. \"But according to Beedle the Bard, they wouldn't want to come back, would they?\" said Harry, thinking about the tale they had just heard. \"I don't suppose there have been loads of other stories about a stone that can raise the dead, have there?\" he asked Hermione. \"No,\" she replied sadly. \"I don't think anyone except Mr. Love-good could kid themselves that's possible. Beedle probably took the idea from the Sorcerer's Stone; you know, instead of a stone to make you immortal, a stone to reverse death.\" The smell from the kitchen was getting stronger: It was something like burning underpants. Harry wondered whether it would be possible to eat enough of whatever Xenophilius was cooking to spare his feelings. \"What about the Cloak, though?\" said Ron slowly. \"Don't you realize, he's right? I've got so used to Harry's Cloak and how good it is, I never stopped to think. I've never heard of one like Harry's. It's infallible. We've never been spotted under it —\" \"Of course not — we're invisible when we're under it, Ron!\" \"But all the stuff he said about other cloaks, and they're not exactly ten a Knut, you know, is true! It's never occurred to me before, but I've heard stuff about charms wearing off cloaks when they get old, or them being ripped apart by spells so they've got holes in.  Harry's was owned by his dad, so it's not exactly new, is it, but it's just . . . perfect!\" \"Yes, all right, but Ron, the stone . . .\" As they argued in whispers, Harry moved around the room, only half listening. Reaching the spiral stair, he raised his eyes absently to the next level and was distracted at once. His own face was looking back at him from the ceiling of the room above. After a moment's bewilderment, he realized that it was not a mirror, but a painting. Curious, he began to climb the stairs. \"Harry, what are you doing? I don't think you should look around when he's not here!\" But Harry had already reached the next level. Luna had decorated her bedroom ceiling with five beautifully painted faces: Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville. They were not moving as the portraits at Hogwarts moved, but there was a certain magic about them all the same: Harry thought they breathed. What appeared to be fine golden chains wove around the pictures, linking them together, but after examining them for a minute or so, Harry realized that the chains were actually one word, repeated a thousand times in golden ink: friends . . . friends . . . friends . . . Harry felt a great rush of affection for Luna. He looked around the room. There was a large photograph beside the bed, of a young Luna and a woman who looked very like her. They were hugging. Luna looked rather better-groomed in this picture than Harry had ever seen her in life. The picture was dusty. This struck Harry as slightly odd. He stared around. Something was wrong. The pale blue carpet was also thick with  dust. There were no clothes in the wardrobe, whose doors stood ajar. The bed had a cold, unfriendly look, as though it had not been slept in for weeks. A single cobweb stretched over the nearest window, across a bloodred sky. \"What's wrong?\" Hermione asked as Harry descended the staircase, but before he could respond, Xenophilius reached the top of the stairs from the kitchen, now holding a tray laden with bowls. \"Mr. Lovegood,\" said Harry. \"Where's Luna?\" \"Excuse me?\" \"Where's Luna?\" Xenophilius halted on the top step. \"I — I've already told you. She is down at Bottom Bridge, fishing for Plimpies.\" \"So why have you only laid that tray for four?\" Xenophilius tried to speak, but no sound came out. The only noise was the continued chugging of the printing press, and a slight rattle from the tray as Xenophilius's hands shook. \"I don't think Luna's been here for weeks,\" said Harry. \"Her clothes are gone, her bed hasn't been slept in. Where is she? And why do you keep looking out of the window?\" Xenophilius dropped the tray: The bowls bounced and smashed. Harry, Ron, and Hermione drew their wands: Xenophilius froze, his hand about to enter his pocket. At that moment the printing press gave a huge bang and numerous Quibblers came streaming across the floor from underneath the tablecloth; the press fell silent at last. Hermione stooped down and picked up one of the magazines, her wand still pointing at Mr. Lovegood. \"Harry, look at this.\" He strode over to her as quickly as he could through all the clutter. The front of The Quibbler carried his own picture, emblazoned with the words Undesirable Number One and captioned with the reward money. \"The Quibbler's going for a new angle, then?\" Harry asked coldly, his mind working very fast. \"Is that what you were doing when you went into the garden, Mr. Lovegood? Sending an owl to the Ministry?\" Xenophilius licked his lips. \"They took my Luna,\" he whispered. \"Because of what I've been writing. They took my Luna and I don't know where she is, what they've done to her. But they might give her back to me if I — if I —\" \"Hand over Harry?\" Hermione finished for him. \"No deal,\" said Ron flatly. \"Get out of the way, we're leaving.\" Xenophilius looked ghastly, a century old, his lips drawn back into a dreadful leer. \"They will be here at any moment. I must save Luna. I cannot lose Luna. You must not leave.\" He spread his arms in front of the staircase, and Harry had a sudden vision of his mother doing the same thing in front of his crib. \"Don't make us hurt you,\" Harry said. \"Get out of the way, Mr. Lovegood.\" \"HARRY!\" Hermione screamed. Figures on broomsticks were flying past the windows. As the three of them looked away from him, Xenophilius drew his wand. Harry realized their mistake just in time: He launched himself sideways, shoving Ron and Hermione out of harm's way as Xenophilius's Stunning Spell soared across the room and hit the Erumpent horn. There was a colossal explosion. The sound of it seemed to blow the room apart: Fragments of wood and paper and rubble flew in all directions, along with an impenetrable cloud of thick white dust. Harry flew through the air, then crashed to the floor, unable to see as debris rained upon him, his arms over his head. He heard Hermione's scream, Ron's yell, and a series of sickening metallic thuds, which told him that Xenophilius had been blasted off his feet and fallen backward down the spiral stairs. Half buried in rubble, Harry tried to raise himself: He could barely breathe or see for dust. Half of the ceiling had fallen in, and the end of Luna's bed was hanging through the hole. The bust of Rowena Ravenclaw lay beside him with half its face missing, fragments of torn parchment were floating through the air, and most of the printing press lay on its side, blocking the top of the staircase to the kitchen. Then another white shape moved close by, and Hermione, coated in dust like a second statue, pressed her finger to her lips. The door downstairs crashed open. \"Didn't I tell you there was no need to hurry, Travers?\" said a rough voice. \"Didn't I tell you this nutter was just raving as usual?\" There was a bang and a scream of pain from Xenophilius. \"No . . . no . . . upstairs . . . Potter!\" \"I told you last week, Lovegood, we weren't coming back for anything less than some solid information! Remember last week? When you wanted to swap your daughter for that stupid bleeding headdress? And the week before\" — another bang, another squeal — \"when you thought we'd give her back if you offered us proof there are Crumple\" — bang — \"Headed\" — bang — \"Snorkacks?\" \"No — no — I beg you!\" sobbed Xenophilius. \"It really is Potter! Really!\" \"And now it turns out you only called us here to try and blow us up!\" roared the Death Eater, and there was a volley of bangs interspersed with squeals of agony from Xenophilius. \"The place looks like it's about to fall in, Selwyn,\" said a cool second voice, echoing up the mangled staircase. \"The stairs are completely blocked. Could try clearing it? Might bring the place down.\" \"You lying piece of filth,\" shouted the wizard named Selwyn. \"You've never seen Potter in your life, have you? Thought you'd lure us here to kill us, did you? And you think you'll get your girl back like this?\" \"I swear . . . I swear . . . Potter's upstairs!\" \"Homenum revelio,\" said the voice at the foot of the stairs. Harry heard Hermione gasp, and he had the odd sensation that something was swooping low over him, immersing his body in its shadow. \"There's someone up there all right, Selwyn,\" said the second man sharply. \"It's Potter, I tell you, it's Potter!\" sobbed Xenophilius. \"Please . . . please . . . give me Luna, just let me have Luna. . . .\" \"You can have your little girl, Lovegood,\" said Selwyn, \"if you get up those stairs and bring me down Harry Potter. But if this is a plot, if it's a trick, if you've got an accomplice waiting up there to ambush us, we'll see if we can spare a bit of your daughter for you to bury.\" Xenophilius gave a wail of fear and despair. There were scurryings and scrapings: Xenophilius was trying to get through the debris on the stairs. \"Come on,\" Harry whispered, \"we've got to get out of here.\" He started to dig himself out under cover of all the noise Xenophilius was making on the staircase. Ron was buried deepest: Harry and Hermione climbed, as quietly as they could, over all the wreckage to where he lay, trying to prise a heavy chest of drawers off his legs. While Xenophilius's banging and scraping drew nearer and nearer, Hermione managed to free Ron with the use of a Hover Charm. \"All right,\" breathed Hermione, as the broken printing press blocking the top of the stairs began to tremble; Xenophilius was feet away from them. She was still white with dust. \"Do you trust me, Harry?\" Harry nodded. \"Okay then,\" Hermione whispered, \"give me the Invisibility Cloak. Ron, you're going to put it on.\" \"Me? But Harry —\" \"Please, Ron! Harry, hold on tight to my hand, Ron, grab my shoulder.\" Harry held out his left hand. Ron vanished beneath the Cloak. The printing press blocking the stairs was vibrating: Xenophilius was trying to shift it using a Hover Charm. Harry did not know what Hermione was waiting for. \"Hold tight,\" she whispered. \"Hold tight . . . any second . . .\" Xenophilius's paper-white face appeared over the top of the sideboard. \"Obliviate!\" cried Hermione, pointing her wand first into his face, then at the floor beneath them. \"Deprimo!\" She had blasted a hole in the sitting room floor. They fell like boulders, Harry still holding onto her hand for dear life; there was a scream from below, and he glimpsed two men trying to get out of the way as vast quantities of rubble and broken furniture rained all around them from the shattered ceiling. Hermione twisted in midair and the thundering of the collapsing house rang in Harry's ears as she dragged him once more into darkness.\n",

      "Harry could feel the Felix Felicis wearing off as he crept back into the castle. The front door had remained unlocked for him, but on the third floor he met Peeves and only narrowly avoided detection by diving sideways through one of his shortcuts. By the time he got up to the portrait of the Fat Lady and pulled off his Invisibility Cloak, he was not surprised to find her in a most unhelpful mood. \"What sort of time do you call this?\" \"I'm really sorry — I had to go out for something important —\" \"Well, the password changed at midnight, so you'll just have to sleep in the corridor, won't you?\" \"You're joking!\" said Harry. \"Why did it have to change at midnight?\" \"That's the way it is,\" said the Fat Lady. \"If you're angry, go and take it up with the headmaster, he's the one who's tightened security.\" \"Fantastic,\" said Harry bitterly, looking around at the hard floor. \"Really brilliant. Yeah, I would go and take it up with Dumbledore if he was here, because he's the one who wanted me to —\" \"He is here,\" said a voice behind Harry. \"Professor Dumbledore returned to the school an hour ago.\" Nearly Headless Nick was gliding toward Harry, his head wobbling as usual upon his ruff. \"I had it from the Bloody Baron, who saw him arrive,\" said Nick. \"He appeared, according to the Baron, to be in good spirits, though a little tired, of course.\" \"Where is he?\" said Harry, his heart leaping. \"Oh, groaning and clanking up on the Astronomy Tower, it's a favorite pastime of his —\" \"Not the Bloody Baron — Dumbledore!\" \"Oh — in his office,\" said Nick. \"I believe, from what the Baron said, that he had business to attend to before turning in —\" \"Yeah, he has,\" said Harry, excitement blazing in his chest at the prospect of telling Dumbledore he had secured the memory. He wheeled about and sprinted off again, ignoring the Fat Lady who was calling after him. \"Come back! All right, I lied! I was annoyed you woke me up! The password's still 'tapeworm'!\" But Harry was already hurtling back along the corridor and within minutes, he was saying \"toffee &eacute;clairs\" to Dumbledore's gargoyle, which leapt aside, permitting Harry entrance onto the spiral staircase. \"Enter,\" said Dumbledore when Harry knocked. He sounded exhausted. Harry pushed open the door. There was Dumbledore's office, looking the same as ever, but with black, star-strewn skies beyond the windows. \"Good gracious, Harry,\" said Dumbledore in surprise. \"To what do I owe this very late pleasure?\" \"Sir — I've got it. I've got the memory from Slughorn.\" Harry pulled out the tiny glass bottle and showed it to Dumbledore. For a moment or two, the headmaster looked stunned. Then his face split in a wide smile. \"Harry, this is spectacular news! Very well done indeed! I knew you could do it!\" All thought of the lateness of the hour apparently forgotten, he hurried around his desk, took the bottle with Slughorn's memory in his uninjured hand, and strode over to the cabinet where he kept the Pensieve. \"And now,\" said Dumbledore, placing the stone basin upon his desk and emptying the contents of the bottle into it. \"Now, at last, we shall see. Harry, quickly . . .\" Harry bowed obediently over the Pensieve and felt his feet leave the office floor. . . . Once again he fell through darkness and landed in Horace Slughorn's office many years before. There was the much younger Slughorn, with his thick, shiny, straw-colored hair and his gingery-blond mustache, sitting again in the comfortable winged armchair in his office, his feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, a small glass of wine in one hand, the other rummaging in a box of crystalized pineapple. And there were the half-dozen teenage boys sitting around Slughorn with Tom Riddle in the midst of them, Marvolo's gold-and-black ring gleaming on his finger. Dumbledore landed beside Harry just as Riddle asked, \"Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?\" \"Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn't tell you,\" said Slughorn, wagging his finger reprovingly at Riddle, though winking at the same time. \"I must say, I'd like to know where you get your information, boy, more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.\" Riddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks. \"What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldn't, and your careful flattery of the people who matter — thank you for the pineapple, by the way, you're quite right, it is my favorite —\" Several of the boys tittered again. \"— I confidently expect you to rise to Minister of Magic within twenty years. Fifteen, if you keep sending me pineapple, I have excellent contacts at the Ministry.\" Tom Riddle merely smiled as the others laughed again. Harry noticed that he was by no means the eldest of the group of boys, but that they all seemed to look to him as their leader. \"I don't know that politics would suit me, sir,\" he said when the laughter had died away. \"I don't have the right kind of background, for one thing.\" A couple of the boys around him smirked at each other. Harry was sure they were enjoying a private joke, undoubtedly about what they knew, or suspected, regarding their gang leader's famous ancestor. \"Nonsense,\" said Slughorn briskly, \"couldn't be plainer you come from decent Wizarding stock, abilities like yours. No, you'll go far, Tom, I've never been wrong about a student yet.\" The small golden clock standing upon Slughorn's desk chimed eleven o'clock behind him and he looked around. \"Good gracious, is it that time already? You'd better get going, boys, or we'll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by tomorrow or it's detention. Same goes for you, Avery.\" One by one, the boys filed out of the room. Slughorn heaved himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk. A movement behind him made him look around; Riddle was still standing there. \"Look sharp, Tom, you don't want to be caught out of bed out of hours, and you a prefect . . .\" \"Sir, I wanted to ask you something.\" \"Ask away, then, m'boy, ask away. . . .\" \"Sir, I wondered what you know about . . . about Horcruxes?\" Slughorn stared at him, his thick fingers absentmindedly caressing the stem of his wine glass. \"Project for Defense Against the Dark Arts, is it?\" But Harry could tell that Slughorn knew perfectly well that this was not schoolwork. \"Not exactly, sir,\" said Riddle. \"I came across the term while reading and I didn't fully understand it.\" \"No . . . well . . . you'd be hard-pushed to find a book at Hog-warts that'll give you details on Horcruxes, Tom, that's very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed,\" said Slughorn. \"But you obviously know all about them, sir? I mean, a wizard like you — sorry, I mean, if you can't tell me, obviously — I just knew if anyone could tell me, you could — so I just thought I'd ask —\" It was very well done, thought Harry, the hesitancy, the casual tone, the careful flattery, none of it overdone. He, Harry, had had too much experience of trying to wheedle information out of reluctant people not to recognize a master at work. He could tell that Riddle wanted the information very, very much; perhaps had been working toward this moment for weeks. \"Well,\" said Slughorn, not looking at Riddle, but fiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of crystalized pineapple, \"well, it can't hurt to give you an overview, of course. Just so that you understand the term. A Horcrux is the word used for an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.\" \"I don't quite understand how that works, though, sir,\" said Riddle. His voice was carefully controlled, but Harry could sense his excitement. \"Well, you split your soul, you see,\" said Slughorn, \"and hide part of it in an object outside the body. Then, even if one's body is attacked or destroyed, one cannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged. But of course, existence in such a form . . .\" Slughorn's face crumpled and Harry found himself remembering words he had heard nearly two years before: \"I was ripped from my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost . . . but still, I was alive.\" \". . . few would want it, Tom, very few. Death would be preferable.\" But Riddle's hunger was now apparent; his expression was greedy, he could no longer hide his longing. \"How do you split your soul?\" \"Well,\" said Slughorn uncomfortably, \"you must understand that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole. Splitting it is an act of violation, it is against nature.\" \"But how do you do it?\" \"By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil. By committing murder. Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion —\" \"Encase? But how — ?\" \"There is a spell, do not ask me, I don't know!\" said Slughorn, shaking his head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes. \"Do I look as though I have tried it — do I look like a killer?\" \"No, sir, of course not,\" said Riddle quickly. \"I'm sorry . . . I didn't mean to offend . . .\" \"Not at all, not at all, not offended,\" said Slughorn gruffly. \"It's natural to feel some curiosity about these things. . . . Wizards of a certain caliber have always been drawn to that aspect of magic. . . .\" \"Yes, sir,\" said Riddle. \"What I don't understand, though — just out of curiosity — I mean, would one Horcrux be much use? Can you only split your soul once? Wouldn't it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces, I mean, for instance, isn't seven the most powerfully magical number, wouldn't seven — ?\" \"Merlin's beard, Tom!\" yelped Slughorn. \"Seven! Isn't it bad enough to think of killing one person? And in any case . . . bad enough to divide the soul . . . but to rip it into seven pieces . . .\" Slughorn looked deeply troubled now: He was gazing at Riddle as though he had never seen him plainly before, and Harry could tell that he was regretting entering into the conversation at all. \"Of course,\" he muttered, \"this is all hypothetical, what we're discussing, isn't it? All academic . . .\" \"Yes, sir, of course,\" said Riddle quickly. \"But all the same, Tom . . . keep it quiet, what I've told — that's to say, what we've discussed. People wouldn't like to think we've been chatting about Horcruxes. It's a banned subject at Hogwarts, you know. . . . Dumbledore's particularly fierce about it. . . .\" \"I won't say a word, sir,\" said Riddle, and he left, but not before Harry had glimpsed his face, which was full of that same wild happiness it had worn when he had first found out that he was a wizard, the sort of happiness that did not enhance his handsome features, but made them, somehow, less human. . . . \"Thank you, Harry,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Let us go. . . .\" When Harry landed back on the office floor Dumbledore was already sitting down behind his desk. Harry sat too and waited for Dumbledore to speak. \"I have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time,\" said Dumbledore at last. \"It confirms the theory on which I have been working, it tells me that I am right, and also how very far there is still to go. . . .\" Harry suddenly noticed that every single one of the old headmasters and headmistresses in the portraits around the walls was awake and listening in on their conversation. A corpulent, red-nosed wizard had actually taken out an ear trumpet. \"Well, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, \"I am sure you understood the significance of what we just heard. At the same age as you are now, give or take a few months, Tom Riddle was doing all he could to find out how to make himself immortal.\" \"You think he succeeded then, sir?\" asked Harry. \"He made a Horcrux? And that's why he didn't die when he attacked me? He had a Horcrux hidden somewhere? A bit of his soul was safe?\" \"A bit . . . or more,\" said Dumbledore. \"You heard Voldemort: What he particularly wanted from Horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one Horcrux, what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times, rip his soul repeatedly, so as to store it in many, separately concealed Horcruxes. No book would have given him that information. As far as I know — as far, I am sure, as Voldemort knew — no wizard had ever done more than tear his soul in two.\" Dumbledore paused for a moment, marshaling his thoughts, and then said, \"Four years ago, I received what I considered certain proof that Voldemort had split his soul.\" \"Where?\" asked Harry \"How?\" \"You handed it to me, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. \"The diary, Riddle's diary, the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets.\" \"I don't understand, sir,\" said Harry. \"Well, although I did not see the Riddle who came out of the diary, what you described to me was a phenomenon I had never witnessed. A mere memory starting to act and think for itself? A mere memory, sapping the life out of the girl into whose hands it had fallen? No, something much more sinister had lived inside that book. . . . a fragment of soul, I was almost sure of it. The diary had been a Horcrux. But this raised as many questions as it answered. \"What intrigued and alarmed me most was that that diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard.\" \"I still don't understand,\" said Harry. \"Well, it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work — in other words, the fragment of soul concealed inside it was kept safe and had undoubtedly played its part in preventing the death of its owner. But there could be no doubt that Riddle really wanted that diary read, wanted the piece of his soul to inhabit or possess somebody else, so that Slytherin's monster would be unleashed again.\" \"Well, he didn't want his hard work to be wasted,\" said Harry. \"He wanted people to know he was Slytherin's heir, because he couldn't take credit at the time.\" \"Quite correct,\" said Dumbledore, nodding. \"But don't you see, Harry, that if he intended the diary to be passed to, or planted on, some future Hogwarts student, he was being remarkably blas&eacute; about that precious fragment of his soul concealed within it. The point of a Horcrux is, as Professor Slughorn explained, to keep part of the self hidden and safe, not to fling it into somebody else's path and run the risk that they might destroy it — as indeed happened: That particular fragment of soul is no more; you saw to that. \"The careless way in which Voldemort regarded this Horcrux seemed most ominous to me. It suggested that he must have made — or been planning to make — more Horcruxes, so that the loss of his first would not be so detrimental. I did not wish to believe it, but nothing else seemed to make sense. \"Then you told me, two years later, that on the night that Voldemort returned to his body, he made a most illuminating and alarming statement to his Death Eaters. 'I, who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality.' That was what you told me he said. 'Further than anybody,' And I thought I knew what that meant, though the Death Eaters did not. He was referring to his Horcruxes, Horcruxes in the plural, Harry, which I do not believe any other wizard has ever had. Yet it fitted: Lord Voldemort has seemed to grow less human with the passing years, and the transformation he has undergone seemed to me to be only explicable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call 'usual evil' . . .\" \"So he's made himself impossible to kill by murdering other people?\" said Harry. \"Why couldn't he make a Sorcerer's Stone, or steal one, if he was so interested in immortality?\" \"Well, we know that he tried to do just that, five years ago,\" said Dumbledore. \"But there are several reasons why, I think, a Sorcerer's Stone would appeal less than Horcruxes to Lord Voldemort. \"While the Elixir of Life does indeed extend life, it must be drunk regularly, for all eternity, if the drinker is to maintain their immortality. Therefore, Voldemort would be entirely dependent on the Elixir, and if it ran out, or was contaminated, or if the Stone was stolen, he would die just like any other man. Voldemort likes to operate alone, remember. I believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent, even on the Elixir, intolerable. Of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible part-life to which he was condemned after attacking you, but only to regain a body. Thereafter, I am convinced, he intended to continue to rely on his Horcruxes: He would need nothing more, if only he could regain a human form. He was already immortal, you see . . . or as close to immortal as any man can be. \"But now, Harry, armed with this information, the crucial memory you have succeeded in procuring for us, we are closer to the secret of finishing Lord Voldemort than anyone has ever been before. You heard him, Harry: 'Wouldn't it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces . . . isn't seven the most powerfully magical number . . .' Isn't seven the most powerfully magical number. Yes, I think the idea of a seven-part soul would greatly appeal to Lord Voldemort.\" \"He made seven Horcruxes?\" said Harry, horror-struck, while several of the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock and outrage. \"But they could be anywhere in the world — hidden — buried or invisible —\" \"I am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem,\" said Dumbledore calmly \"But firstly, no, Harry, not seven Horcruxes: six. The seventh part of his soul, however maimed, resides inside his regenerated body. That was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years during his exile; without that, he has no self at all. That seventh piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to kill Voldemort must attack — the piece that lives in his body.\" \"But the six Horcruxes, then,\" said Harry, a little desperately, \"how are we supposed to find them?\" \"You are forgetting . . . you have already destroyed one of them. And I have destroyed another.\" \"You have?\" said Harry eagerly. \"Yes indeed,\" said Dumbledore, and he raised his blackened, burned-looking hand. \"The ring, Harry. Marvolo's ring. And a terrible curse there was upon it too. Had it not been — forgive me the lack of seemly modesty — for my own prodigious skill, and for Professor Snape's timely action when I returned to Hogwarts, desperately injured, I might not have lived to tell the tale. However, a withered hand does not seem an unreasonable exchange for a seventh of Voldemort's soul. The ring is no longer a Horcrux.\" \"But how did you find it?\" \"Well, as you now know, for many years I have made it my business to discover as much as I can about Voldemort's past life. I have traveled widely, visiting those places he once knew. I stumbled across the ring hidden in the ruin of the Gaunts' house. It seems that once Voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul inside it, he did not want to wear it anymore. He hid it, protected by many powerful enchantments, in the shack where his ancestors had once lived (Morfin having been carted off to Azkaban, of course), never guessing that I might one day take the trouble to visit the ruin, or that I might be keeping an eye open for traces of magical concealment. \"However, we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily. You destroyed the diary and I the ring, but if we are right in our theory of a seven-part soul, four Horcruxes remain.\" \"And they could be anything?\" said Harry. \"They could be old tin cans or, I dunno, empty potion bottles. . . .\" \"You are thinking of Portkeys, Harry, which must be ordinary objects, easy to overlook. But would Lord Voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul? You are forgetting what I have showed you. Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies, and he preferred objects with a powerful magical history. His pride, his belief in his own superiority, his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history; these things suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxes with some care, favoring objects worthy of the honor.\" \"The diary wasn't that special.\" \"The diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was the  Heir of Slytherin; I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stupendous importance.\" \"So, the other Horcruxes?\" said Harry. \"Do you think you know what they are, sir?\" \"I can only guess,\" said Dumbledore. \"For the reasons I have already given, I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects that, in themselves, have a certain grandeur. I have therefore trawled back through Voldemort's past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around him.\" \"The locket!\" said Harry loudly. \"Hufflepuff 's cup!\" \"Yes,\" said Dumbledore, smiling, \"I would be prepared to bet — perhaps not my other hand — but a couple of fingers, that they became Horcruxes three and four. The remaining two, assuming again that he created a total of six, are more of a problem, but I will hazard a guess that, having secured objects from Hufflepuff and Slytherin, he set out to track down objects owned by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw. Four objects from the four founders would, I am sure, have exerted a powerful pull over Voldemort's imagination. I cannot answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of Ravenclaw's. I am confident, however, that the only known relic of Gryffindor remains safe.\" Dumbledore pointed his blackened fingers to the wall behind him, where a ruby-encrusted sword reposed within a glass case. \"Do you think that's why he really wanted to come back to Hog-warts, sir?\" said Harry. \"To try and find something from one of the other founders?\" \"My thoughts precisely,\" said Dumbledore. \"But unfortunately, that does not advance us much further, for he was turned away, or  so I believe, without the chance to search the school. I am forced to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founders' objects. He definitely had two — he may have found three — that is the best we can do for now.\" \"Even if he got something of Ravenclaw's or of Gryffindor's, that leaves a sixth Horcrux,\" said Harry, counting on his fingers. \"Unless he got both?\" \"I don't think so,\" said Dumbledore. \"I think I know what the sixth Horcrux is. I wonder what you will say when I confess that I have been curious for a while about the behavior of the snake, Nagini?\" \"The snake?\" said Harry, startled. \"You can use animals as Horcruxes?\" \"Well, it is inadvisable to do so,\" said Dumbledore, \"because to confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business. However, if my calculations are correct, Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short of his goal of six when he entered your parents' house with the intention of killing you. \"He seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for particularly significant deaths. You would certainly have been that. He believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined. He believed he was making himself invincible. I am sure that he was intending to make his final Horcrux with your death. \"As we know, he failed. After an interval of some years, however, he used Nagini to kill an old Muggle man, and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcrux. She underlines the Slytherin connection, which enhances Lord Voldemort's mystique; I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything; he certainly likes to keep her close, and he seems to have an unusual amount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth.\" \"So,\" said Harry, \"the diary's gone, the ring's gone. The cup, the locket, and the snake are still intact, and you think there might be a Horcrux that was once Ravenclaw's or Gryffindor's?\" \"An admirably succinct and accurate summary, yes,\" said Dumbledore, bowing his head. \"So . . . are you still looking for them, sir? Is that where you've been going when you've been leaving the school?\" \"Correct,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have been looking for a very long time. I think . . . perhaps . . . I may be close to finding another one. There are hopeful signs.\" \"And if you do,\" said Harry quickly, \"can I come with you and help get rid of it?\" Dumbledore looked at Harry very intently for a moment before saying, \"Yes, I think so.\" \"I can?\" said Harry, thoroughly taken aback. \"Oh yes,\" said Dumbledore, smiling slightly. \"I think you have earned that right.\" Harry felt his heart lift. It was very good not to hear words of caution and protection for once. The headmasters and headmistresses around the walls seemed less impressed by Dumbledore's decision; Harry saw a few of them shaking their heads and Phineas Nigellus actually snorted. \"Does Voldemort know when a Horcrux is destroyed, sir? Can he feel it?\" Harry asked, ignoring the portraits. \"A very interesting question, Harry. I believe not. I believe that Voldemort is now so immersed in evil, and these crucial parts of himself have been detached for so long, he does not feel as we do. Perhaps, at the point of death, he might be aware of his loss . . . but he was not aware, for instance, that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of Lucius Malfoy. When Voldemort discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers, I am told that his anger was terrible to behold.\" \"But I thought he meant Lucius Malfoy to smuggle it into Hog-warts?\" \"Yes, he did, years ago, when he was sure he would be able to create more Horcruxes, but still Lucius was supposed to wait for Voldemort's say-so, and he never received it, for Voldemort vanished shortly after giving him the diary. \"No doubt he thought that Lucius would not dare do anything with the Horcrux other than guard it carefully, but he was counting too much upon Lucius's fear of a master who had been gone for years and whom Lucius believed dead. Of course, Lucius did not know what the diary really was. I understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a portion of his master's soul in his hands, he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence — but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends: By planting the diary upon Arthur Weasley's daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly incriminating magical object in one stroke. Ah, poor Lucius . . . what with Voldemort's fury about the fact that he threw away the Horcrux for his own gain, and the fiasco at the Ministry last year, I would not be surprised if he is not secretly glad to be safe in Azkaban at the moment.\" Harry sat in thought for a moment, then asked, \"So if all of his Horcruxes are destroyed, Voldemort could be killed?\" \"Yes, I think so,\" said Dumbledore. \"Without his Horcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, his brain and his magical powers remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes.\" \"But I haven't got uncommon skill and power,\" said Harry, before he could stop himself. \"Yes, you have,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can —\" \"I know!\" said Harry impatiently. \"I can love!\" It was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding, \"Big deal!\" \"Yes, Harry, you can love,\" said Dumbledore, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying. \"Which, given everything that has happened to you, is a great and remarkable thing. You are still too young to understand how unusual you are, Harry.\" \"So, when the prophecy says that I'll have 'power the Dark Lord knows not,' it just means — love?\" asked Harry, feeling a little let down. \"Yes — just love,\" said Dumbledore. \"But Harry, never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because Voldemort made it so. I told you this at the end of last year. Voldemort singled you out as the person who would be most dangerous to him — and in doing so, he made you the person who would be most dangerous to him!\" \"But it comes to the same —\" \"No, it doesn't!\" said Dumbledore, sounding impatient now. Pointing at Harry with his black, withered hand, he said, \"You are setting too much store by the prophecy!\" \"But,\" spluttered Harry, \"but you said the prophecy means —\" \"If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would it have been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? Of course not! Do you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled?\" \"But,\" said Harry, bewildered, \"but last year, you said one of us would have to kill the other —\" \"Harry, Harry, only because Voldemort made a grave error, and acted on Professor Trelawney's words! If Voldemort had never murdered your father, would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge? Of course not! If he had not forced your mother to die for you, would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate? Of course not, Harry! Don't you see? Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different! Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt into action, with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he handed him uniquely deadly weapons!\" \"But —\" \"It is essential that you understand this!\" said Dumbledore, standing up and striding about the room, his glittering robes swooshing in his wake; Harry had never seen him so agitated. \"By attempting to kill you, Voldemort himself singled out the remarkable person who sits here in front of me, and gave him the tools for the job! It is Voldemort's fault that you were able to see into his thoughts, his ambitions, that you even understand the snakelike language in which he gives orders, and yet, Harry, despite your privileged insight into Voldemort's world (which, incidentally, is a gift any Death Eater would kill to have), you have never been seduced by the Dark Arts, never, even for a second, shown the slightest desire to become one of Voldemort's followers!\" \"Of course I haven't!\" said Harry indignantly. \"He killed my mum and dad!\" \"You are protected, in short, by your ability to love!\" said Dumbledore loudly. \"The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort's! In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mirror that reflected your heart's desire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not immortality or riches. Harry, have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror? Voldemort should have known then what he was dealing with, but he did not! \"But he knows it now. You have flitted into Lord Voldemort's mind without damage to yourself, but he cannot possess you without enduring mortal agony, as he discovered in the Ministry. I do not think he understands why, Harry, but then, he was in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul, he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul that is untarnished and whole.\" \"But, sir,\" said Harry, making valiant efforts not to sound argumentative, \"it all comes to the same thing, doesn't it? I've got to try and kill him, or —\" \"Got to?\" said Dumbledore. \"Of course you've got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until you've tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!\" Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat. \"I'd want him finished,\" said Harry quietly. \"And I'd want to do it.\" \"Of course you would!\" cried Dumbledore. \"You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal. . . . In other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you . . . which makes it certain, really, that —\" \"That one of us is going to end up killing the other,\" said Harry. \"Yes.\" But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew — and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents — that there was all the difference in the world.\n",

      "Your — ?\" \"My dear old mum, yeah,\" said Sirius. \"We've been trying to get her down for a month but we think she put a Permanent Sticking Charm on the back of the canvas. Let's get downstairs, quick, before they all wake up again.\" \"But what's a portrait of your mother doing here?\" Harry asked, bewildered, as they went through the door from the hall and led the way down a flight of narrow stone steps, the others just behind them. \"Hasn't anyone told you? This was my parents' house,\" said Sirius. \"But I'm the last Black left, so it's mine now. I offered it to Dumbledore for headquarters — about the only useful thing I've been able to do.\" Harry, who had expected a better welcome, noted how hard and bitter Sirius's voice sounded. He followed his godfather to the bottom of the stairs and through a door leading into the basement kitchen. It was scarcely less gloomy than the hall above, a cavernous room with rough stone walls. Most of the light was coming from a large fire at the far end of the room. A haze of pipe smoke hung in the air like battle fumes, through which loomed the menacing shapes of heavy iron pots and pans hanging from the dark ceiling. Many chairs had been crammed into the room for the meeting and a long wooden table stood in the middle of the room, littered with rolls of parchment, goblets, empty wine bottles, and a heap of what appeared to be rags. Mr. Weasley and his eldest son, Bill, were talking quietly with their heads together at the end of the table. Mrs. Weasley cleared her throat. Her husband, a thin, balding, red-haired man, who wore horn-rimmed glasses, looked around and jumped to his feet. \"Harry!\" Mr. Weasley said, hurrying forward to greet him and shaking his hand vigorously. \"Good to see you!\" Over his shoulder Harry saw Bill, who still wore his long hair in a ponytail, hastily rolling up the lengths of parchment left on the table. \"Journey all right, Harry?\" Bill called, trying to gather up twelve scrolls at once. \"Mad-Eye didn't make you come via Greenland, then?\" \"He tried,\" said Tonks, striding over to help Bill and immediately sending a candle toppling onto the last piece of parchment. \"Oh no — sorry —\" \"Here, dear,\" said Mrs. Weasley, sounding exasperated, and she repaired the parchment with a wave of her wand: In the flash of light caused by Mrs. Weasley's charm, Harry caught a glimpse of what looked like the plan of a building. Mrs. Weasley had seen him looking. She snatched the plan off the table and stuffed it into Bill's heavily laden arms. \"This sort of thing ought to be cleared away promptly at the end of meetings,\" she snapped before sweeping off toward an ancient dresser from which she started unloading dinner plates. Bill took out his wand, muttered \"Evanesco!\" and the scrolls vanished. \"Sit down, Harry,\" said Sirius. \"You've met Mundungus, haven't you?\" The thing Harry had taken to be a pile of rags gave a prolonged, grunting snore and then jerked awake. \"Some'n say m' name?\" Mundungus mumbled sleepily. \"I 'gree with Sirius. . . .\" He raised a very grubby hand in the air as though voting, his droopy, bloodshot eyes unfocused. Ginny giggled. \"The meeting's over, Dung,\" said Sirius, as they all sat down around him at the table. \"Harry's arrived.\" \"Eh?\" said Mundungus, peering balefully at Harry through his matted ginger hair. \"Blimey, so 'e 'as. Yeah . . . you all right, 'arry?\" \"Yeah,\" said Harry. Mundungus fumbled nervously in his pockets, still staring at Harry, and pulled out a grimy black pipe. He stuck it in his mouth, ignited the end of it with his wand, and took a deep pull on it. Great billowing clouds of greenish smoke obscured him in seconds. \"Owe you a 'pology,\" grunted a voice from the middle of the smelly cloud. \"For the last time, Mundungus,\" called Mrs. Weasley, \"will you please not smoke that thing in the kitchen, especially not when we're about to eat!\" \"Ah,\" said Mundungus. \"Right. Sorry, Molly.\" The cloud of smoke vanished as Mundungus stowed his pipe back in his pocket, but an acrid smell of burning socks lingered. \"And if you want dinner before midnight I'll need a hand,\" Mrs. Weasley said to the room at large. \"No, you can stay where you are, Harry dear, you've had a long journey —\" \"What can I do, Molly?\" said Tonks enthusiastically, bounding forward. Mrs. Weasley hesitated, looking apprehensive. \"Er — no, it's all right, Tonks, you have a rest too, you've done enough today —\" \"No, no, I want to help!\" said Tonks brightly, knocking over a chair as she hurried toward the dresser from which Ginny was collecting cutlery. Soon a series of heavy knives were chopping meat and vegetables of their own accord, supervised by Mr. Weasley, while Mrs. Weasley stirred a cauldron dangling over the fire and the others took out plates, more goblets, and food from the pantry. Harry was left at the table with Sirius and Mundungus, who was still blinking mournfully at him. \"Seen old Figgy since?\" he asked. \"No,\" said Harry, \"I haven't seen anyone.\" \"See, I wouldn't 'ave left,\" said Mundungus, leaning forward, a pleading note in his voice, \"but I 'ad a business opportunity —\" Harry felt something brush against his knees and started, but it was only Crookshanks, Hermione's bandy-legged ginger cat, who wound himself once around Harry's legs, purring, then jumped onto Sirius's lap and curled up. Sirius scratched him absentmindedly behind the ears as he turned, still grim-faced, to Harry. \"Had a good summer so far?\" \"No, it's been lousy,\" said Harry. For the first time, something like a grin flitted across Sirius's face. \"Don't know what you're complaining about, myself.\" \"What?\" said Harry incredulously. \"Personally, I'd have welcomed a dementor attack. A deadly struggle for my soul would have broken the monotony nicely. You think you've had it bad, at least you've been able to get out and about, stretch your legs, get into a few fights. . . . I've been stuck inside for a month.\" \"How come?\" asked Harry, frowning. \"Because the Ministry of Magic's still after me, and Voldemort will know all about me being an Animagus by now, Wormtail will have told him, so my big disguise is useless. There's not much I can do for the Order of the Phoenix . . . or so Dumbledore feels.\" There was something about the slightly flattened tone of voice in which Sirius uttered Dumbledore's name that told Harry that Sirius was not very happy with the headmaster either. Harry felt a sudden upsurge of affection for his godfather. \"At least you've known what's been going on,\" he said bracingly. \"Oh yeah,\" said Sirius sarcastically. \"Listening to Snape's reports, having to take all his snide hints that he's out there risking his life while I'm sat on my backside here having a nice comfortable time . . . asking me how the cleaning's going —\" \"What cleaning?\" asked Harry. \"Trying to make this place fit for human habitation,\" said Sirius, waving a hand around the dismal kitchen. \"No one's lived here for ten years, not since my dear mother died, unless you count her old house-elf, and he's gone round the twist, hasn't cleaned anything in ages —\" \"Sirius?\" said Mundungus, who did not appear to have paid any attention to this conversation, but had been minutely examining an empty goblet. \"This solid silver, mate?\" \"Yes,\" said Sirius, surveying it with distaste. \"Finest fifteenth-century goblin-wrought silver, embossed with the Black family crest.\" \"That'd come off, though,\" muttered Mundungus, polishing it with his cuff. \"Fred — George — NO, JUST CARRY THEM!\" Mrs. Weasley shrieked. Harry, Sirius, and Mundungus looked around and, a split second later, dived away from the table. Fred and George had bewitched a large cauldron of stew, an iron flagon of butterbeer, and a heavy wooden breadboard, complete with knife, to hurtle through the air toward them. The stew skidded the length of the table and came to a halt just before the end, leaving a long black burn on the wooden surface, the flagon of butterbeer fell with a crash, spilling its contents everywhere, and the bread knife slipped off the board and landed, point down and quivering ominously, exactly where Sirius's right hand had been seconds before. \"FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE!\" screamed Mrs. Weasley. \"THERE WAS NO NEED — I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS — JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE ALLOWED TO USE MAGIC NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO WHIP YOUR WANDS OUT FOR EVERY TINY LITTLE THING!\" \"We were just trying to save a bit of time!\" said Fred, hurrying forward and wrenching the bread knife out of the table. \"Sorry Sirius, mate — didn't mean to —\" Harry and Sirius were both laughing. Mundungus, who had toppled backward off his chair, was swearing as he got to his feet. Crook-shanks had given an angry hiss and shot off under the dresser, from whence his large yellow eyes glowed in the darkness. \"Boys,\" Mr. Weasley said, lifting the stew back into the middle of the table, \"your mother's right, you're supposed to show a sense of responsibility now you've come of age —\" \"— none of your brothers caused this sort of trouble!\" Mrs. Weasley raged at the twins, slamming a fresh flagon of butterbeer onto the table and spilling almost as much again. \"Bill didn't feel the need to Apparate every few feet! Charlie didn't Charm everything he met! Percy —\" She stopped dead, catching her breath with a frightened look at her husband, whose expression was suddenly wooden. \"Let's eat,\" said Bill quickly. \"It looks wonderful, Molly,\" said Lupin, ladling stew onto a plate for her and handing it across the table. For a few minutes there was silence but for the chink of plates and cutlery and the scraping of chairs as everyone settled down to their food. Then Mrs. Weasley turned to Sirius and said, \"I've been meaning to tell you, there's something trapped in that writing desk in the drawing room, it keeps rattling and shaking. Of course, it could just be a boggart, but I thought we ought to ask Alastor to have a look at it before we let it out.\" \"Whatever you like,\" said Sirius indifferently. \"The curtains in there are full of doxies too,\" Mrs. Weasley went on. \"I thought we might try and tackle them tomorrow.\" \"I look forward to it,\" said Sirius. Harry heard the sarcasm in his voice, but he was not sure that anyone else did. Opposite Harry, Tonks was entertaining Hermione and Ginny by transforming her nose between mouthfuls. Screwing up her eyes each time with the same pained expression she had worn back in Harry's bedroom, her nose swelled to a beaklike protuberance like Snape's, shrank to something resembling a button mushroom, and then sprouted a great deal of hair from each nostril. Apparently this was a regular mealtime entertainment, because after a while Hermione and Ginny started requesting their favorite noses. \"Do that one like a pig snout, Tonks . . .\" Tonks obliged, and Harry, looking up, had the fleeting impression that a female Dudley was grinning at him from across the table. Mr. Weasley, Bill, and Lupin were having an intense discussion about goblins. \"They're not giving anything away yet,\" said Bill. \"I still can't work out whether they believe he's back or not. 'Course, they might prefer not to take sides at all. Keep out of it.\" \"I'm sure they'd never go over to You-Know-Who,\" said Mr. Weasley, shaking his head. \"They've suffered losses too. Remember that goblin family he murdered last time, somewhere near Nottingham?\" \"I think it depends what they're offered,\" said Lupin. \"And I'm not talking about gold; if they're offered freedoms we've been denying them for centuries they're going to be tempted. Have you still not had any luck with Ragnok, Bill?\" \"He's feeling pretty anti-wizard at the moment,\" said Bill. \"He hasn't stopped raging about the Bagman business, he reckons the Ministry did a cover-up, those goblins never got their gold from him, you know —\" A gale of laughter from the middle of the table drowned the rest of Bill's words. Fred, George, Ron, and Mundungus were rolling around in their seats. \". . . and then,\" choked Mundungus, tears running down his face, \"and then, if you'll believe it, 'e says to me, 'e says, ' 'ere, Dung, where didja get all them toads from? 'Cos some son of a Bludger's gone and nicked all mine!' And I says, 'Nicked all your toads, Will, what next? So you'll be wanting some more, then?' And if you'll believe me, lads, the gormless gargoyle buys all 'is own toads back orf me for twice what 'e paid in the first place —\" \"I don't think we need to hear any more of your business dealings, thank you very much, Mundungus,\" said Mrs. Weasley sharply, as Ron slumped forward onto the table, howling with laughter. \"Beg pardon, Molly,\" said Mundungus at once, wiping his eyes and winking at Harry. \"But, you know, Will nicked 'em orf Warty Harris in the first place so I wasn't really doing nothing wrong —\" \"I don't know where you learned about right and wrong, Mundungus, but you seem to have missed a few crucial lessons,\" said Mrs. Weasley coldly. Fred and George buried their faces in their goblets of butterbeer; George was hiccuping. For some reason, Mrs. Weasley threw a very nasty look at Sirius before getting to her feet and going to fetch a large rhubarb crumble for pudding. Harry looked round at his godfather. \"Molly doesn't approve of Mundungus,\" said Sirius in an undertone. \"How come he's in the Order?\" Harry said very quietly. \"He's useful,\" Sirius muttered. \"Knows all the crooks — well, he would, seeing as he's one himself. But he's also very loyal to Dumble- dore, who helped him out of a tight spot once. It pays to have someone like Dung around, he hears things we don't. But Molly thinks inviting him to stay for dinner is going too far. She hasn't forgiven him for slipping off duty when he was supposed to be tailing you.\" Three helpings of rhubarb crumble and custard later and the waistband on Harry's jeans was feeling uncomfortably tight (which was saying something, as the jeans had once been Dudley's). He lay down his spoon in a lull in the general conversation. Mr. Weasley was leaning back in his chair, looking replete and relaxed, Tonks was yawning widely, her nose now back to normal, and Ginny, who had lured Crookshanks out from under the dresser, was sitting cross-legged on the floor, rolling butterbeer corks for him to chase. \"Nearly time for bed, I think,\" said Mrs. Weasley on a yawn. \"Not just yet, Molly,\" said Sirius, pushing away his empty plate and turning to look at Harry. \"You know, I'm surprised at you. I thought the first thing you'd do when you got here would be to start asking questions about Voldemort.\" The atmosphere in the room changed with the rapidity Harry associated with the arrival of dementors. Where seconds before it had been sleepily relaxed, it was now alert, even tense. A frisson had gone around the table at the mention of Voldemort's name. Lupin, who had been about to take a sip of wine, lowered his goblet slowly, looking wary. \"I did!\" said Harry indignantly. \"I asked Ron and Hermione but they said we're not allowed in the Order, so —\" \"And they're quite right,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"You're too young.\" She was sitting bolt upright in her chair, her fists clenched upon its arms, every trace of drowsiness gone. \"Since when did someone have to be in the Order of the Phoenix to ask questions?\" asked Sirius. \"Harry's been trapped in that Muggle house for a month. He's got the right to know what's been happen —\" \"Hang on!\" interrupted George loudly. \"How come Harry gets his questions answered?\" said Fred angrily. \"We've been trying to get stuff out of you for a month and you haven't told us a single stinking thing!\" said George. \"'You're too young, you're not in the Order,'\" said Fred, in a high-pitched voice that sounded uncannily like his mother's. \"Harry's not even of age!\" \"It's not my fault you haven't been told what the Order's doing,\" said Sirius calmly. \"That's your parents' decision. Harry, on the other hand —\" \"It's not down to you to decide what's good for Harry!\" said Mrs. Weasley sharply. Her normally kindly face looked dangerous. \"You haven't forgotten what Dumbledore said, I suppose?\" \"Which bit?\" Sirius asked politely, but with an air as though readying himself for a fight. \"The bit about not telling Harry more than he needs to know,\" said Mrs. Weasley, placing a heavy emphasis on the last three words. Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George's heads turned from Sirius to Mrs. Weasley as though following a tennis rally. Ginny was kneeling amid a pile of abandoned butterbeer corks, watching the conversation with her mouth slightly open. Lupin's eyes were fixed on Sirius. \"I don't intend to tell him more than he needs to know, Molly,\" said Sirius. \"But as he was the one who saw Voldemort come back\" (again, there was a collective shudder around the table at the name), \"he has more right than most to —\" \"He's not a member of the Order of the Phoenix!\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"He's only fifteen and —\" \"— and he's dealt with as much as most in the Order,\" said Sirius, \"and more than some —\" \"No one's denying what he's done!\" said Mrs. Weasley, her voice rising, her fists trembling on the arms of her chair. \"But he's still —\" \"He's not a child!\" said Sirius impatiently. \"He's not an adult either!\" said Mrs. Weasley, the color rising in her cheeks. \"He's not James, Sirius!\" \"I'm perfectly clear who he is, thanks, Molly,\" said Sirius coldly. \"I'm not sure you are!\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Sometimes, the way you talk about him, it's as though you think you've got your best friend back!\" \"What's wrong with that?\" said Harry. \"What's wrong, Harry, is that you are not your father, however much you might look like him!\" said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes still boring into Sirius. \"You are still at school and adults responsible for you should not forget it!\" \"Meaning I'm an irresponsible godfather?\" demanded Sirius, his voice rising. \"Meaning you've been known to act rashly, Sirius, which is why Dumbledore keeps reminding you to stay at home and —\" \"We'll leave my instructions from Dumbledore out of this, if you please!\" said Sirius loudly. \"Arthur!\" said Mrs. Weasley, rounding on her husband. \"Arthur, back me up!\" Mr. Weasley did not speak at once. He took off his glasses and cleaned them slowly on his robes, not looking at his wife. Only when he had replaced them carefully on his nose did he say, \"Dumbledore knows the position has changed, Molly. He accepts that Harry will have to be filled in to a certain extent now that he is staying at headquarters —\" \"Yes, but there's a difference between that and inviting him to ask whatever he likes!\" \"Personally,\" said Lupin quietly, looking away from Sirius at last, as Mrs. Weasley turned quickly to him, hopeful that finally she was about to get an ally, \"I think it better that Harry gets the facts — not all the facts, Molly, but the general picture — from us, rather than a garbled version from . . . others.\" His expression was mild, but Harry felt sure that Lupin, at least, knew that some Extendable Ears had survived Mrs. Weasley's purge. \"Well,\" said Mrs. Weasley, breathing deeply and looking around the table for support that did not come, \"well . . . I can see I'm going to be overruled. I'll just say this: Dumbledore must have had his reasons for not wanting Harry to know too much, and speaking as someone who has got Harry's best interests at heart —\" \"He's not your son,\" said Sirius quietly. \"He's as good as,\" said Mrs. Weasley fiercely. \"Who else has he got?\" \"He's got me!\" \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Weasley, her lip curling. \"The thing is, it's been rather difficult for you to look after him while you've been locked up in Azkaban, hasn't it?\" Sirius started to rise from his chair. \"Molly, you're not the only person at this table who cares about Harry,\" said Lupin sharply. \"Sirius, sit down.\" Mrs. Weasley's lower lip was trembling. Sirius sank slowly back into his chair, his face white. \"I think Harry ought to be allowed a say in this,\" Lupin continued. \"He's old enough to decide for himself.\" \"I want to know what's been going on,\" Harry said at once. He did not look at Mrs. Weasley. He had been touched by what she had said about his being as good as a son, but he was also impatient at her mollycoddling. . . . Sirius was right, he was not a child. \"Very well,\" said Mrs. Weasley, her voice cracking. \"Ginny — Ron — Hermione — Fred — George — I want you out of this kitchen, now.\" There was instant uproar. \"We're of age!\" Fred and George bellowed together. \"If Harry's allowed, why can't I?\" shouted Ron. \"Mum, I want to!\" wailed Ginny. \"NO!\" shouted Mrs. Weasley, standing up, her eyes overbright. \"I absolutely forbid —\" \"Molly, you can't stop Fred and George,\" said Mr. Weasley wearily. \"They are of age —\" \"They're still at school —\" \"But they're legally adults now,\" said Mr. Weasley in the same tired voice. Mrs. Weasley was now scarlet in the face. \"I — oh, all right then, Fred and George can stay, but Ron —\" \"Harry'll tell me and Hermione everything you say anyway!\" said Ron hotly. \"Won't — won't you?\" he added uncertainly, meeting Harry's eyes. For a split second, Harry considered telling Ron that he wouldn't tell him a single word, that he could try a taste of being kept in the dark and see how he liked it. But the nasty impulse vanished as they looked at each other. \" 'Course I will,\" Harry said. Ron and Hermione beamed. \"Fine!\" shouted Mrs. Weasley. \"Fine! Ginny — BED!\" Ginny did not go quietly. They could hear her raging and storming at her mother all the way up the stairs, and when she reached the hall Mrs. Black's earsplitting shrieks were added to the din. Lupin hurried off to the portrait to restore calm. It was only after he had returned, closing the kitchen door behind him and taking his seat at the table again, that Sirius spoke. \"Okay, Harry . . . what do you want to know?\" Harry took a deep breath and asked the question that had been obsessing him for a month. \"Where's Voldemort? What's he doing? I've been trying to watch the Muggle news,\" he said, ignoring the renewed shudders and winces at the name, \"and there hasn't been anything that looks like him yet, no funny deaths or anything —\" \"That's because there haven't been any suspicious deaths yet,\" said Sirius, \"not as far as we know, anyway. . . . And we know quite a lot.\" \"More than he thinks we do anyway,\" said Lupin. \"How come he's stopped killing people?\" Harry asked. He knew that Voldemort had murdered more than once in the last year alone. \"Because he doesn't want to draw attention to himself at the moment,\" said Sirius. \"It would be dangerous for him. His comeback didn't come off quite the way he wanted it to, you see. He messed it up.\" \"Or rather, you messed it up for him,\" said Lupin with a satisfied smile. \"How?\" Harry asked perplexedly. \"You weren't supposed to survive!\" said Sirius. \"Nobody apart from his Death Eaters was supposed to know he'd come back. But you survived to bear witness.\" \"And the very last person he wanted alerted to his return the moment he got back was Dumbledore,\" said Lupin. \"And you made sure Dumbledore knew at once.\" \"How has that helped?\" Harry asked. \"Are you kidding?\" said Bill incredulously. \"Dumbledore was the only one You-Know-Who was ever scared of!\" \"Thanks to you, Dumbledore was able to recall the Order of the Phoenix about an hour after Voldemort returned,\" said Sirius. \"So what's the Order been doing?\" said Harry, looking around at them all. \"Working as hard as we can to make sure Voldemort can't carry out his plans,\" said Sirius. \"How d'you know what his plans are?\" Harry asked quickly. \"Dumbledore's got a shrewd idea,\" said Lupin, \"and Dumbledore's shrewd ideas normally turn out to be accurate.\" \"So what does Dumbledore reckon he's planning?\" \"Well, firstly, he wants to build up his army again,\" said Sirius. \"In the old days he had huge numbers at his command; witches and wizards he'd bullied or bewitched into following him, his faithful Death Eaters, a great variety of Dark creatures. You heard him planning to recruit the giants; well, they'll be just one group he's after. He's certainly not going to try and take on the Ministry of Magic with only a dozen Death Eaters.\" \"So you're trying to stop him getting more followers?\" \"We're doing our best,\" said Lupin. \"How?\" \"Well, the main thing is to try and convince as many people as possible that You-Know-Who really has returned, to put them on their guard,\" said Bill. \"It's proving tricky, though.\" \"Why?\" \"Because of the Ministry's attitude,\" said Tonks. \"You saw Cornelius Fudge after You-Know-Who came back, Harry. Well, he hasn't shifted his position at all. He's absolutely refusing to believe it's happened.\" \"But why?\" said Harry desperately. \"Why's he being so stupid? If Dumbledore —\" \"Ah, well, you've put your finger on the problem,\" said Mr. Weasley with a wry smile. \"Dumbledore.\" \"Fudge is frightened of him, you see,\" said Tonks sadly. \"Frightened of Dumbledore?\" said Harry incredulously. \"Frightened of what he's up to,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"You see, Fudge thinks Dumbledore's plotting to overthrow him. He thinks Dumbledore wants to be Minister of Magic.\" \"But Dumbledore doesn't want —\" \"Of course he doesn't,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"He's never wanted the Minister's job, even though a lot of people wanted him to take it when Millicent Bagnold retired. Fudge came to power instead, but he's never quite forgotten how much popular support Dumbledore had, even though Dumbledore never applied for the job.\" \"Deep down, Fudge knows Dumbledore's much cleverer than he is, a much more powerful wizard, and in the early days of his Ministry he was forever asking Dumbledore for help and advice,\" said Lupin. \"But it seems that he's become fond of power now, and much more confident. He loves being Minister of Magic, and he's managed to convince himself that he's the clever one and Dumbledore's simply stirring up trouble for the sake of it.\" \"How can he think that?\" said Harry angrily. \"How can he think Dumbledore would just make it all up — that I'd make it all up?\" \"Because accepting that Voldemort's back would mean trouble like the Ministry hasn't had to cope with for nearly fourteen years,\" said Sirius bitterly. \"Fudge just can't bring himself to face it. It's so much more comfortable to convince himself Dumbledore's lying to destabilize him.\" \"You see the problem,\" said Lupin. \"While the Ministry insists there is nothing to fear from Voldemort, it's hard to convince people he's back, especially as they really don't want to believe it in the first place. What's more, the Ministry's leaning heavily on the Daily Prophet not to report any of what they're calling Dumbledore's rumormongering, so most of the Wizarding community are completely unaware anything's happened, and that makes them easy targets for the Death Eaters if they're using the Imperius Curse.\" \"But you're telling people, aren't you?\" said Harry, looking around at Mr. Weasley, Sirius, Bill, Mundungus, Lupin, and Tonks. \"You're letting people know he's back?\" They all smiled humorlessly. \"Well, as everyone thinks I'm a mad mass murderer and the Ministry's put a ten-thousand-Galleon price on my head, I can hardly stroll up the street and start handing out leaflets, can I?\" said Sirius restlessly. \"And I'm not a very popular dinner guest with most of the community,\" said Lupin. \"It's an occupational hazard of being a werewolf.\" \"Tonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry if they started shooting their mouths off,\" said Sirius, \"and it's very important for us to have spies inside the Ministry, because you can bet Voldemort will have them.\" \"We've managed to convince a couple of people, though,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"Tonks here, for one — she's too young to have been in the Order of the Phoenix last time, and having Aurors on our side is a huge advantage — Kingsley Shacklebolt's been a real asset too. He's in charge of the hunt for Sirius, so he's been feeding the Ministry information that Sirius is in Tibet.\" \"But if none of you's putting the news out that Voldemort's back —\" Harry began. \"Who said none of us was putting the news out?\" said Sirius. \"Why d'you think Dumbledore's in such trouble?\" \"What d'you mean?\" Harry asked. \"They're trying to discredit him,\" said Lupin. \"Didn't you see the Daily Prophet last week? They reported that he'd been voted out of the Chairmanship of the International Confederation of Wizards because he's getting old and losing his grip, but it's not true, he was voted out by Ministry wizards after he made a speech announcing Voldemort's return. They've demoted him from Chief Warlock on the Wizengamot — that's the Wizard High Court — and they're talking about taking away his Order of Merlin, First Class, too.\" \"But Dumbledore says he doesn't care what they do as long as they don't take him off the Chocolate Frog cards,\" said Bill, grinning. \"It's no laughing matter,\" said Mr. Weasley shortly. \"If he carries on defying the Ministry like this, he could end up in Azkaban and the last thing we want is Dumbledore locked up. While You-Know-Who knows Dumbledore's out there and wise to what he's up to, he's going to go cautiously for a while. If Dumbledore's out of the way — well, You-Know-Who will have a clear field.\" \"But if Voldemort's trying to recruit more Death Eaters, it's bound to get out that he's come back, isn't it?\" asked Harry desperately. \"Voldemort doesn't march up to people's houses and bang on their front doors, Harry,\" said Sirius. \"He tricks, jinxes, and blackmails them. He's well-practiced at operating in secrecy. In any case, gathering followers is only one thing he's interested in, he's got other plans too, plans he can put into operation very quietly indeed, and he's concentrating on them at the moment.\" \"What's he after apart from followers?\" Harry asked swiftly. He thought he saw Sirius and Lupin exchange the most fleeting of looks before Sirius said, \"Stuff he can only get by stealth.\" When Harry continued to look puzzled, Sirius said, \"Like a weapon. Something he didn't have last time.\" \"When he was powerful before?\" \"Yes.\" \"Like what kind of weapon?\" said Harry. \"Something worse than the Avada Kedavra — ?\" \"That's enough.\" Mrs. Weasley spoke from the shadows beside the door. Harry had not noticed her return from taking Ginny upstairs. Her arms were crossed and she looked furious. \"I want you in bed, now. All of you,\" she added, looking around at Fred, George, Ron, and Hermione. \"You can't boss us —\" Fred began. \"Watch me,\" snarled Mrs. Weasley. She was trembling slightly as she looked at Sirius. \"You've given Harry plenty of information. Any more and you might just as well induct him into the Order straightaway.\" \"Why not?\" said Harry quickly. \"I'll join, I want to join, I want to fight —\" \"No.\" It was not Mrs. Weasley who spoke this time, but Lupin. \"The Order is comprised only of overage wizards,\" he said. \"Wizards who have left school,\" he added, as Fred and George opened their mouths. \"There are dangers involved of which you can have no idea, any of you . . . I think Molly's right, Sirius. We've said enough.\" Sirius half-shrugged but did not argue. Mrs. Weasley beckoned imperiously to her sons and Hermione. One by one they stood up and Harry, recognizing defeat, followed suit.\n",

      "Clutching their purchases, Mr. Weasley in the lead, they all hurried into the wood, following the lantern-lit trail. They could hear the sounds of thousands of people moving around them, shouts and laughter, snatches of singing. The atmosphere of feverish excitement was highly infectious; Harry couldn't stop grinning. They walked through the wood for twenty minutes, talking and joking loudly, until at last they emerged on the other side and found themselves in the shadow of a gigantic stadium. Though Harry could see only a fraction of the immense gold walls surrounding the field, he could tell that ten cathedrals would fit comfortably inside it. \"Seats a hundred thousand,\" said Mr. Weasley, spotting the awestruck look on Harry's face. \"Ministry task force of five hundred have been working on it all year. Muggle Repelling Charms on every inch of it. Every time Muggles have got anywhere near here all year, they've suddenly remembered urgent appointments and had to dash away again . . . bless them,\" he added fondly, leading the way toward the nearest entrance, which was already surrounded by a swarm of shouting witches and wizards. \"Prime seats!\" said the Ministry witch at the entrance when she checked their tickets. \"Top Box! Straight upstairs, Arthur, and as high as you can go.\" The stairs into the stadium were carpeted in rich purple. They clambered upward with the rest of the crowd, which slowly filtered away through doors into the stands to their left and right. Mr. Weasley's party kept climbing, and at last they reached the top of the staircase and found themselves in a small box, set at the highest point of the stadium and situated exactly halfway between the golden goal posts. About twenty purple-and-gilt chairs stood in two rows here, and Harry, filing into the front seats with the Weasleys, looked down upon a scene the likes of which he could never have imagined. A hundred thousand witches and wizards were taking their places in the seats, which rose in levels around the long oval field. Everything was suffused with a mysterious golden light, which seemed to come from the stadium itself. The field looked smooth as velvet from their lofty position. At either end of the field stood three goal hoops, fifty feet high; right opposite them, almost at Harry's eye level, was a gigantic blackboard. Gold writing kept dashing across it as though an invisible giant's hand were scrawling upon the blackboard and then wiping it off again; watching it, Harry saw that it was flashing advertisements across the field. The Bluebottle: A Broom for All the Family — safe, reliable, and with Built-in Anti-Burglar Buzzer . . . Mrs. Skower's All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover: No Pain, No Stain! . . . Gladrags Wizardwear — London, Paris, Hogsmeade . . . Harry tore his eyes away from the sign and looked over his shoulder to see who else was sharing the box with them. So far it was empty, except for a tiny creature sitting in the second from last seat at the end of the row behind them. The creature, whose legs were so short they stuck out in front of it on the chair, was wearing a tea towel draped like a toga, and it had its face hidden in its hands. Yet those long, batlike ears were oddly familiar. . . . \"Dobby?\" said Harry incredulously. The tiny creature looked up and stretched its fingers, revealing enormous brown eyes and a nose the exact size and shape of a large tomato. It wasn't Dobby — it was, however, unmistakably a house-elf, as Harry's friend Dobby had been. Harry had set Dobby free from his old owners, the Malfoy family. \"Did sir just call me Dobby?\" squeaked the elf curiously from between its fingers. Its voice was higher even than Dobby's had been, a teeny, quivering squeak of a voice, and Harry suspected — though it was very hard to tell with a house-elf — that this one might just be female. Ron and Hermione spun around in their seats to look. Though they had heard a lot about Dobby from Harry, they had never actually met him. Even Mr. Weasley looked around in interest. \"Sorry,\" Harry told the elf, \"I just thought you were someone I knew.\" \"But I knows Dobby too, sir!\" squeaked the elf. She was shielding her face, as though blinded by light, though the Top Box was not brightly lit. \"My name is Winky, sir — and you, sir —\" Her dark brown eyes widened to the size of side plates as they rested upon Harry's scar. \"You is surely Harry Potter!\" \"Yeah, I am,\" said Harry. \"But Dobby talks of you all the time, sir!\" she said, lowering her hands very slightly and looking awestruck. \"How is he?\" said Harry. \"How's freedom suiting him?\" \"Ah, sir,\" said Winky, shaking her head, \"ah sir, meaning no disrespect, sir, but I is not sure you did Dobby a favor, sir, when you is setting him free.\" \"Why?\" said Harry, taken aback. \"What's wrong with him?\" \"Freedom is going to Dobby's head, sir,\" said Winky sadly. \"Ideas above his station, sir. Can't get another position, sir.\" \"Why not?\" said Harry. Winky lowered her voice by a half-octave and whispered, \"He is wanting paying for his work, sir.\" \"Paying?\" said Harry blankly. \"Well — why shouldn't he be paid?\" Winky looked quite horrified at the idea and closed her fingers slightly so that her face was half-hidden again. \"House-elves is not paid, sir!\" she said in a muffled squeak. \"No, no, no. I says to Dobby, I says, go find yourself a nice family and settle down, Dobby. He is getting up to all sorts of high jinks, sir, what is unbecoming to a house-elf. You goes racketing around like this, Dobby, I says, and next thing I hear you's up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, like some common goblin.\" \"Well, it's about time he had a bit of fun,\" said Harry. \"House-elves is not supposed to have fun, Harry Potter,\" said Winky firmly, from behind her hands. \"House-elves does what they is told. I is not liking heights at all, Harry Potter\" — she glanced toward the edge of the box and gulped — \"but my master sends me to the Top Box and I comes, sir.\" \"Why's he sent you up here, if he knows you don't like heights?\" said Harry, frowning. \"Master — master wants me to save him a seat, Harry Potter. He is very busy,\" said Winky, tilting her head toward the empty space beside her. \"Winky is wishing she is back in master's tent, Harry Potter, but Winky does what she is told. Winky is a good house-elf.\" She gave the edge of the box another frightened look and hid her eyes completely again. Harry turned back to the others. \"So that's a house-elf?\" Ron muttered. \"Weird things, aren't they?\" \"Dobby was weirder,\" said Harry fervently. Ron pulled out his Omnioculars and started testing them, staring down into the crowd on the other side of the stadium. \"Wild!\" he said, twiddling the replay knob on the side. \"I can make that old bloke down there pick his nose again . . . and again . . . and again . . .\" Hermione, meanwhile, was skimming eagerly through her velvet-covered, tasseled program. \" 'A display from the team mascots will precede the match,' \" she read aloud. \"Oh that's always worth watching,\" said Mr. Weasley. \"National teams bring creatures from their native land, you know, to put on a bit of a show.\" The box filled gradually around them over the next half hour. Mr. Weasley kept shaking hands with people who were obviously very important wizards. Percy jumped to his feet so often that he looked as though he were trying to sit on a hedgehog. When Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic himself, arrived, Percy bowed so low that his glasses fell off and shattered. Highly embarrassed, he repaired them with his wand and thereafter remained in his seat, throwing jealous looks at Harry, whom Cornelius Fudge had greeted like an old friend. They had met before, and Fudge shook Harry's hand in a fatherly fashion, asked how he was, and introduced him to the wizards on either side of him. \"Harry Potter, you know,\" he told the Bulgarian minister loudly, who was wearing splendid robes of black velvet trimmed with gold and didn't seem to understand a word of English. \"Harry Potter . . . oh come on now, you know who he is . . . the boy who survived You-Know-Who . . . you do know who he is —\" The Bulgarian wizard suddenly spotted Harry's scar and started gabbling loudly and excitedly, pointing at it. \"Knew we'd get there in the end,\" said Fudge wearily to Harry. \"I'm no great shakes at languages; I need Barty Crouch for this sort of thing. Ah, I see his house-elf's saving him a seat. . . . Good job too, these Bulgarian blighters have been trying to cadge all the best places . . . ah, and here's Lucius!\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned quickly. Edging along the second row to three still-empty seats right behind Mr. Weasley were none other than Dobby the house-elf's former owners: Lucius Malfoy; his son, Draco; and a woman Harry supposed must be Draco's mother. Harry and Draco Malfoy had been enemies ever since their very first journey to Hogwarts. A pale boy with a pointed face and white-blond hair, Draco greatly resembled his father. His mother was blonde too; tall and slim, she would have been nice-looking if she hadn't been wearing a look that suggested there was a nasty smell under her nose. \"Ah, Fudge,\" said Mr. Malfoy, holding out his hand as he reached the Minister of Magic. \"How are you? I don't think you've met my wife, Narcissa? Or our son, Draco?\" \"How do you do, how do you do?\" said Fudge, smiling and bowing to Mrs. Malfoy. \"And allow me to introduce you to Mr. Oblansk — Obalonsk — Mr. — well, he's the Bulgarian Minister of Magic, and he can't understand a word I'm saying anyway, so never mind. And let's see who else — you know Arthur Weasley, I daresay?\" It was a tense moment. Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy looked at each other and Harry vividly recalled the last time they had come face-to-face: It had been in Flourish and Blotts' bookshop, and they had had a fight. Mr. Malfoy's cold gray eyes swept over Mr. Weasley, and then up and down the row. \"Good lord, Arthur,\" he said softly. \"What did you have to sell to get seats in the Top Box? Surely your house wouldn't have fetched this much?\" Fudge, who wasn't listening, said, \"Lucius has just given a very generous contribution to St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, Arthur. He's here as my guest.\" \"How — how nice,\" said Mr. Weasley, with a very strained smile. Mr. Malfoy's eyes had returned to Hermione, who went slightly pink, but stared determinedly back at him. Harry knew exactly what was making Mr. Malfoy's lip curl like that. The Malfoys prided themselves on being purebloods; in other words, they considered anyone of Muggle descent, like Hermione, second-class. However, under the gaze of the Minister of Magic, Mr. Malfoy did-n't dare say anything. He nodded sneeringly to Mr. Weasley and continued down the line to his seats. Draco shot Harry, Ron, and Hermione one contemptuous look, then settled himself between his mother and father. \"Slimy gits,\" Ron muttered as he, Harry, and Hermione turned to face the field again. Next moment, Ludo Bagman charged into the box. \"Everyone ready?\" he said, his round face gleaming like a great, excited Edam. \"Minister — ready to go?\" \"Ready when you are, Ludo,\" said Fudge comfortably. Ludo whipped out his wand, directed it at his own throat, and said \"Sonorus!\" and then spoke over the roar of sound that was now filling the packed stadium; his voice echoed over them, booming into every corner of the stands. \"Ladies and gentlemen . . . welcome! Welcome to the final of the four hundred and twenty-second Quidditch World Cup!\" The spectators screamed and clapped. Thousands of flags waved, adding their discordant national anthems to the racket. The huge blackboard opposite them was wiped clear of its last message (Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans — A Risk With Every Mouthful!) and now showed BULGARIA: 0, IRELAND: 0. \"And now, without further ado, allow me to introduce . . . the Bulgarian National Team Mascots!\" The right-hand side of the stands, which was a solid block of scarlet, roared its approval. \"I wonder what they've brought,\" said Mr. Weasley, leaning forward in his seat. \"Aaah!\" He suddenly whipped off his glasses and polished them hurriedly on his robes. \"Veela!\" \"What are veel — ?\" But a hundred veela were now gliding out onto the field, and Harry's question was answered for him. Veela were women . . . the most beautiful women Harry had ever seen . . . except that they weren't — they couldn't be — human. This puzzled Harry for a moment while he tried to guess what exactly they could be; what could make their skin shine moon-bright like that, or their white-gold hair fan out behind them without wind . . . but then the music started, and Harry stopped worrying about them not being human — in fact, he stopped worrying about anything at all. The veela had started to dance, and Harry's mind had gone completely and blissfully blank. All that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the veela, because if they stopped dancing, terrible things would happen. . . . And as the veela danced faster and faster, wild, half-formed thoughts started chasing through Harry's dazed mind. He wanted to do something very impressive, right now. Jumping from the box into the stadium seemed a good idea . . . but would it be good enough? \"Harry, what are you doing?\" said Hermione's voice from a long way off. The music stopped. Harry blinked. He was standing up, and one of his legs was resting on the wall of the box. Next to him, Ron was frozen in an attitude that looked as though he were about to dive from a springboard. Angry yells were filling the stadium. The crowd didn't want the  veela to go. Harry was with them; he would, of course, be supporting Bulgaria, and he wondered vaguely why he had a large green shamrock pinned to his chest. Ron, meanwhile, was absentmindedly shredding the shamrocks on his hat. Mr. Weasley, smiling slightly, leaned over to Ron and tugged the hat out of his hands. \"You'll be wanting that,\" he said, \"once Ireland have had their say. \"Huh?\" said Ron, staring openmouthed at the veela, who had now lined up along one side of the field. Hermione made a loud tutting noise. She reached up and pulled Harry back into his seat. \"Honestly!\" she said. \"And now,\" roared Ludo Bagman's voice, \"kindly put your wands in the air . . . for the Irish National Team Mascots!\" Next moment, what seemed to be a great green-and-gold comet came zooming into the stadium. It did one circuit of the stadium, then split into two smaller comets, each hurtling toward the goal posts. A rainbow arced suddenly across the field, connecting the two balls of light. The crowd oooohed and aaaaahed, as though at a fireworks display. Now the rainbow faded and the balls of light reunited and merged; they had formed a great shimmering shamrock, which rose up into the sky and began to soar over the stands. Something like golden rain seemed to be falling from it — \"Excellent!\" yelled Ron as the shamrock soared over them, and heavy gold coins rained from it, bouncing off their heads and seats. Squinting up at the shamrock, Harry realized that it was actually comprised of thousands of tiny little bearded men with red vests, each carrying a minute lamp of gold or green. \"Leprechauns!\" said Mr. Weasley over the tumultuous applause of the crowd, many of whom were still fighting and rummaging around under their chairs to retrieve the gold. \"There you go,\" Ron yelled happily, stuffing a fistful of gold coins into Harry's hand, \"for the Omnioculars! Now you've got to buy me a Christmas present, ha!\" The great shamrock dissolved, the leprechauns drifted down onto the field on the opposite side from the veela, and settled themselves cross-legged to watch the match. \"And now, ladies and gentlemen, kindly welcome — the Bulgarian National Quidditch Team! I give you — Dimitrov!\" A scarlet-clad figure on a broomstick, moving so fast it was blurred, shot out onto the field from an entrance far below, to wild applause from the Bulgarian supporters. \"Ivanova!\" A second scarlet-robed player zoomed out. \"Zograf! Levski! Vulchanov! Volkov! Aaaaaaand — Krum!\" \"That's him, that's him!\" yelled Ron, following Krum with his Omnioculars. Harry quickly focused his own. Viktor Krum was thin, dark, and sallow-skinned, with a large curved nose and thick black eyebrows. He looked like an overgrown bird of prey. It was hard to believe he was only eighteen. \"And now, please greet — the Irish National Quidditch Team!\" yelled Bagman. \"Presenting — Connolly! Ryan! Troy! Mullet! Moran! Quigley! Aaaaaand — Lynch!\" Seven green blurs swept onto the field; Harry spun a small dial on the side of his Omnioculars and slowed the players down enough to read the word \"Firebolt\" on each of their brooms and see their names, embroidered in silver, upon their backs. \"And here, all the way from Egypt, our referee, acclaimed Chairwizard of the International Association of Quidditch, Hassan Mostafa!\" A small and skinny wizard, completely bald but with a mustache to rival Uncle Vernon's, wearing robes of pure gold to match the stadium, strode out onto the field. A silver whistle was protruding from under the mustache, and he was carrying a large wooden crate under one arm, his broomstick under the other. Harry spun the speed dial on his Omnioculars back to normal, watching closely as Mostafa mounted his broomstick and kicked the crate open — four balls burst into the air: the scarlet Quaffle, the two black Bludgers, and (Harry saw it for the briefest moment, before it sped out of sight) the minuscule, winged Golden Snitch. With a sharp blast on his whistle, Mostafa shot into the air after the balls. \"Theeeeeeeey're OFF!\" screamed Bagman. \"And it's Mullet! Troy! Moran! Dimitrov! Back to Mullet! Troy! Levski! Moran!\" It was Quidditch as Harry had never seen it played before. He was pressing his Omnioculars so hard to his glasses that they were cutting into the bridge of his nose. The speed of the players was incredible — the Chasers were throwing the Quaffle to one another so fast that Bagman only had time to say their names. Harry spun the slow dial on the right of his Omnioculars again, pressed the play-by-play button on the top, and he was immediately watching in slow motion, while glittering purple lettering flashed across the lenses and the noise of the crowd pounded against his eardrums. HAWKSHEAD ATTACKING FORMATION, he read as he watched the three Irish Chasers zoom closely together, Troy in the center, slightly ahead of Mullet and Moran, bearing down upon the Bulgarians. PORSKOFF PLOY flashed up next, as Troy made as though to dart upward with the Quaffle, drawing away the Bulgarian Chaser Ivanova and dropping the Quaffle to Moran. One of the Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov, swung hard at a passing Bludger with his small club, knocking it into Moran's path; Moran ducked to avoid the Bludger and dropped the Quaffle; and Levski, soaring beneath, caught it — \"TROY SCORES!\" roared Bagman, and the stadium shuddered with a roar of applause and cheers. \"Ten zero to Ireland!\" \"What?\" Harry yelled, looking wildly around through his Omnioculars. \"But Levski's got the Quaffle!\" \"Harry, if you're not going to watch at normal speed, you're going to miss things!\" shouted Hermione, who was dancing up and down, waving her arms in the air while Troy did a lap of honor around the field. Harry looked quickly over the top of his Omni-oculars and saw that the leprechauns watching from the sidelines had all risen into the air again and formed the great, glittering shamrock. Across the field, the veela were watching them sulkily. Furious with himself, Harry spun his speed dial back to normal as play resumed. Harry knew enough about Quidditch to see that the Irish Chasers were superb. They worked as a seamless team, their movements so well coordinated that they appeared to be reading one another's minds as they positioned themselves, and the rosette on Harry's chest kept squeaking their names: \"Troy — Mullet — Moran!\" And within ten minutes, Ireland had scored twice more, bringing their lead to thirty-zero and causing a thunderous tide of roars and applause from the green-clad supporters. The match became still faster, but more brutal. Volkov and Vulchanov, the Bulgarian Beaters, were whacking the Bludgers as fiercely as possible at the Irish Chasers, and were starting to prevent them from using some of their best moves; twice they were forced to scatter, and then, finally, Ivanova managed to break through their ranks; dodge the Keeper, Ryan; and score Bulgaria's first goal. \"Fingers in your ears!\" bellowed Mr. Weasley as the veela started to dance in celebration. Harry screwed up his eyes too; he wanted to keep his mind on the game. After a few seconds, he chanced a glance at the field. The veela had stopped dancing, and Bulgaria was again in possession of the Quaffle. \"Dimitrov! Levski! Dimitrov! Ivanova — oh I say!\" roared Bagman. One hundred thousand wizards gasped as the two Seekers, Krum and Lynch, plummeted through the center of the Chasers, so fast that it looked as though they had just jumped from airplanes without parachutes. Harry followed their descent through his Omnioculars, squinting to see where the Snitch was — \"They're going to crash!\" screamed Hermione next to Harry. She was half right — at the very last second, Viktor Krum pulled out of the dive and spiraled off. Lynch, however, hit the ground with a dull thud that could be heard throughout the stadium. A huge groan rose from the Irish seats. \"Fool!\" moaned Mr. Weasley. \"Krum was feinting!\" \"It's time-out!\" yelled Bagman's voice, \"as trained mediwizards hurry onto the field to examine Aidan Lynch!\" \"He'll be okay, he only got ploughed!\" Charlie said reassuringly to Ginny, who was hanging over the side of the box, looking horror-struck. \"Which is what Krum was after, of course. . . .\" Harry hastily pressed the replay and play-by-play buttons on his Omnioculars, twiddled the speed dial, and put them back up to his eyes. He watched as Krum and Lynch dived again in slow motion. WRONSKI DEFENSIVE FEINT — DANGEROUS SEEKER DIVERSION read the shining purple lettering across his lenses. He saw Krum's face contorted with concentration as he pulled out of the dive just in time, while Lynch was flattened, and he understood — Krum hadn't seen the Snitch at all, he was just making Lynch copy him. Harry had never seen anyone fly like that; Krum hardly looked as though he was using a broomstick at all; he moved so easily through the air that he looked unsupported and weightless. Harry turned his Omnioculars back to normal and focused them on Krum. He was now circling high above Lynch, who was being revived by mediwizards with cups of potion. Harry, focusing still more closely upon Krum's face, saw his dark eyes darting all over the ground a hundred feet below. He was using the time while Lynch was revived to look for the Snitch without interference. Lynch got to his feet at last, to loud cheers from the green-clad supporters, mounted his Firebolt, and kicked back off into the air. His revival seemed to give Ireland new heart. When Mostafa blew his whistle again, the Chasers moved into action with a skill unrivaled by anything Harry had seen so far. After fifteen more fast and furious minutes, Ireland had pulled ahead by ten more goals. They were now leading by one hundred and thirty points to ten, and the game was starting to get dirtier. As Mullet shot toward the goal posts yet again, clutching the Quaffle tightly under her arm, the Bulgarian Keeper, Zograf, flew out to meet her. Whatever happened was over so quickly Harry didn't catch it, but a scream of rage from the Irish crowd, and Mostafa's long, shrill whistle blast, told him it had been a foul. \"And Mostafa takes the Bulgarian Keeper to task for cobbing — excessive use of elbows!\" Bagman informed the roaring spectators. \"And — yes, it's a penalty to Ireland!\" The leprechauns, who had risen angrily into the air like a swarm of glittering hornets when Mullet had been fouled, now darted together to form the words \"HA, HA, HA!\" The veela on the other side of the field leapt to their feet, tossed their hair angrily, and started to dance again. As one, the Weasley boys and Harry stuffed their fingers into their ears, but Hermione, who hadn't bothered, was soon tugging on Harry's arm. He turned to look at her, and she pulled his fingers impatiently out of his ears. \"Look at the referee!\" she said, giggling. Harry looked down at the field. Hassan Mostafa had landed right in front of the dancing veela, and was acting very oddly indeed. He was flexing his muscles and smoothing his mustache excitedly. \"Now, we can't have that!\" said Ludo Bagman, though he sounded highly amused. \"Somebody slap the referee!\" A mediwizard came tearing across the field, his fingers stuffed into his own ears, and kicked Mostafa hard in the shins. Mostafa seemed to come to himself; Harry, watching through the Omnioculars again, saw that he looked exceptionally embarrassed and had started shouting at the veela, who had stopped dancing and were looking mutinous. \"And unless I'm much mistaken, Mostafa is actually attempting to send off the Bulgarian team mascots!\" said Bagman's voice. \"Now there's something we haven't seen before. . . . Oh this could turn nasty. . . .\" It did: The Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov and Vulchanov, landed on either side of Mostafa and began arguing furiously with him, gesticulating toward the leprechauns, who had now gleefully formed the words \"HEE, HEE, HEE.\" Mostafa was not impressed by the Bulgarians' arguments, however; he was jabbing his finger into the air, clearly telling them to get flying again, and when they refused, he gave two short blasts on his whistle. \"Two penalties for Ireland!\" shouted Bagman, and the Bulgarian crowd howled with anger. \"And Volkov and Vulchanov had better get back on those brooms . . . yes . . . there they go . . . and Troy takes the Quaffle . . .\" Play now reached a level of ferocity beyond anything they had yet seen. The Beaters on both sides were acting without mercy: Volkov and Vulchanov in particular seemed not to care whether their clubs made contact with Bludger or human as they swung them violently through the air. Dimitrov shot straight at Moran, who had the Quaffle, nearly knocking her off her broom. \"Foul !\" roared the Irish supporters as one, all standing up in a great wave of green. \"Foul!\" echoed Ludo Bagman's magically magnified voice. \"Dimitrov skins Moran — deliberately flying to collide there — and it's got to be another penalty — yes, there's the whistle!\" The leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field. At this, the veela lost control. Instead of dancing, they launched themselves across the field and began throwing what seemed to be handfuls of fire at the leprechauns. Watching through his Omnioculars, Harry saw that they didn't look remotely beautiful now. On the contrary, their faces were elongating into sharp, cruel-beaked bird heads, and long, scaly wings were bursting from their shoulders — \"And that, boys,\" yelled Mr. Weasley over the tumult of the crowd below, \"is why you should never go for looks alone!\" Ministry wizards were flooding onto the field to separate the veela and the leprechauns, but with little success; meanwhile, the pitched battle below was nothing to the one taking place above. Harry turned this way and that, staring through his Omnioculars, as the Quaffle changed hands with the speed of a bullet. \"Levski — Dimitrov — Moran — Troy — Mullet — Ivanova — Moran again — Moran — MORAN SCORES!\" But the cheers of the Irish supporters were barely heard over the shrieks of the veela, the blasts now issuing from the Ministry members' wands, and the furious roars of the Bulgarians. The game recommenced immediately; now Levski had the Quaffle, now Dimitrov — The Irish Beater Quigley swung heavily at a passing Bludger, and hit it as hard as possible toward Krum, who did not duck quickly enough. It hit him full in the face. There was a deafening groan from the crowd; Krum's nose looked broken, there was blood everywhere, but Hassan Mostafa didn't blow his whistle. He had become distracted, and Harry couldn't blame him; one of the veela had thrown a handful of fire and set his broom tail alight. Harry wanted someone to realize that Krum was injured; even though he was supporting Ireland, Krum was the most exciting player on the field. Ron obviously felt the same. \"Time-out! Ah, come on, he can't play like that, look at him —\" \"Look at Lynch!\" Harry yelled. For the Irish Seeker had suddenly gone into a dive, and Harry  was quite sure that this was no Wronski Feint; this was the real thing. . . . \"He's seen the Snitch!\" Harry shouted. \"He's seen it! Look at him go!\" Half the crowd seemed to have realized what was happening; the Irish supporters rose in another great wave of green, screaming their Seeker on . . . but Krum was on his tail. How he could see where he was going, Harry had no idea; there were flecks of blood flying through the air behind him, but he was drawing level with Lynch now as the pair of them hurtled toward the ground again — \"They're going to crash!\" shrieked Hermione. \"They're not!\" roared Ron. \"Lynch is!\" yelled Harry. And he was right — for the second time, Lynch hit the ground with tremendous force and was immediately stampeded by a horde of angry veela. \"The Snitch, where's the Snitch?\" bellowed Charlie, along the row. \"He's got it — Krum's got it — it's all over!\" shouted Harry. Krum, his red robes shining with blood from his nose, was rising gently into the air, his fist held high, a glint of gold in his hand. The scoreboard was flashing BULGARIA: 160, IRELAND: 170 across the crowd, who didn't seem to have realized what had happened. Then, slowly, as though a great jumbo jet were revving up, the rumbling from the Ireland supporters grew louder and louder and erupted into screams of delight. \"IRELAND WINS!\" Bagman shouted, who like the Irish, seemed to be taken aback by the sudden end of the match.  \"KRUM GETS THE SNITCH — BUT IRELAND WINS — good lord, I don't think any of us were expecting that!\" \"What did he catch the Snitch for?\" Ron bellowed, even as he jumped up and down, applauding with his hands over his head. \"He ended it when Ireland were a hundred and sixty points ahead, the idiot!\" \"He knew they were never going to catch up!\" Harry shouted back over all the noise, also applauding loudly. \"The Irish Chasers were too good. . . . He wanted to end it on his terms, that's all. . . .\" \"He was very brave, wasn't he?\" Hermione said, leaning forward to watch Krum land as a swarm of mediwizards blasted a path through the battling leprechauns and veela to get to him. \"He looks a terrible mess. . . .\" Harry put his Omnioculars to his eyes again. It was hard to see what was happening below, because leprechauns were zooming delightedly all over the field, but he could just make out Krum, surrounded by mediwizards. He looked surlier than ever and refused to let them mop him up. His team members were around him, shaking their heads and looking dejected; a short way away, the Irish players were dancing gleefully in a shower of gold descending from their mascots. Flags were waving all over the stadium, the Irish national anthem blared from all sides; the veela were shrinking back into their usual, beautiful selves now, though looking dispirited and forlorn. \"Vell, ve fought bravely,\" said a gloomy voice behind Harry. He looked around; it was the Bulgarian Minister of Magic. \"You can speak English!\" said Fudge, sounding outraged. \"And you've been letting me mime everything all day!\" \"Vell, it vos very funny,\" said the Bulgarian minister, shrugging. \"And as the Irish team performs a lap of honor, flanked by their mascots, the Quidditch World Cup itself is brought into the Top Box!\" roared Bagman. Harry's eyes were suddenly dazzled by a blinding white light, as the Top Box was magically illuminated so that everyone in the stands could see the inside. Squinting toward the entrance, he saw two panting wizards carrying a vast golden cup into the box, which they handed to Cornelius Fudge, who was still looking very disgruntled that he'd been using sign language all day for nothing. \"Let's have a really loud hand for the gallant losers — Bulgaria!\" Bagman shouted. And up the stairs into the box came the seven defeated Bulgarian players. The crowd below was applauding appreciatively; Harry could see thousands and thousands of Omniocular lenses flashing and winking in their direction. One by one, the Bulgarians filed between the rows of seats in the box, and Bagman called out the name of each as they shook hands with their own minister and then with Fudge. Krum, who was last in line, looked a real mess. Two black eyes were blooming spectacularly on his bloody face. He was still holding the Snitch. Harry noticed that he seemed much less coordinated on the ground. He was slightly duck-footed and distinctly round-shouldered. But when Krum's name was announced, the whole stadium gave him a resounding, earsplitting roar. And then came the Irish team. Aidan Lynch was being supported by Moran and Connolly; the second crash seemed to have dazed him and his eyes looked strangely unfocused. But he grinned  happily as Troy and Quigley lifted the Cup into the air and the crowd below thundered its approval. Harry's hands were numb with clapping. At last, when the Irish team had left the box to perform another lap of honor on their brooms (Aidan Lynch on the back of Connolly's, clutching hard around his waist and still grinning in a bemused sort of way), Bagman pointed his wand at his throat and muttered, \"Quietus.\" \"They'll be talking about this one for years,\" he said hoarsely, \"a really unexpected twist, that. . . . shame it couldn't have lasted longer. . . . Ah yes. . . . yes, I owe you . . . how much?\" For Fred and George had just scrambled over the backs of their seats and were standing in front of Ludo Bagman with broad grins on their faces, their hands outstretched.\n",
